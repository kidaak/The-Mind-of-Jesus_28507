<p><span class="smcap">The Mind of Jesus</span>! What a study is this! To attain
a dim reflection of it, is the ambition of angels&mdash;higher
they can not soar. &ldquo;To be conformed to the image of
His Son!&rdquo;&mdash;it is the end of God in the predestination
of His Church from all eternity. &ldquo;We shall be like
Him!&rdquo;&mdash;it is the Bible picture of <i>heaven</i>!</p>

<p>In a former little volume, we pondered some of the
gracious <i>Words</i> which proceeded out of the mouth of
Jesus. In the present, we have a few faint lineaments
of that holy <i>Character</i> which constituted the living exposition
and embodiment of His precepts.</p>

<p>But how lofty such a standard! How all creature-perfection
shrinks abashed and confounded before a Divine
portraiture like this! He is the true &ldquo;Angel standing
in the sun,&rdquo; who alone projects no shadow; so bathed in
the glories of Deity that likeness to Him becomes like
the light in which He is shrouded&mdash;&ldquo;no man can approach
unto it.&rdquo; May we not, however, seek at least to
approximate, though we can not adequately resemble?
It is impossible on earth to associate with a fellow-being
without getting, in some degree, assimilated to him. So,
the more we study &ldquo;the Mind of Christ,&rdquo; the more we
are in His company&mdash;holding converse with Him as our
best and dearest friend&mdash;catching up his holy looks and
holy deeds&mdash;the more shall we be &ldquo;transformed into the
same image.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider,&rdquo; says the Great Apostle (literally &lsquo;<i>gaze</i> on&rsquo;)
&ldquo;Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Heb. iii. 1). Study feature by feature,
lineament by lineament, of that Peerless Exemplar.
&ldquo;<i>Gaze</i>&rdquo; on the Sun of Righteousness, till, like gazing long
on the natural sun, you carry away with you, on your
spiritual vision, dazzling images of His brightness and
glory. Though He be the Archetype of all goodness,
remember He is no shadowy model&mdash;though the Infinite
Jehovah, He was &ldquo;the <i>Man</i> Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We must never, indeed, forget that it is not the <i>mind</i>,
but the <i>work</i> of Immanuel, which lies at the foundation
of a sinner&#8217;s hope. He must be known as a <i>Saviour</i>,
before He is studied as an <i>Example</i>. His doing and dying
is the center jewel, of which all the virtues of His holy
life are merely the setting. But neither must we overlook
the Scripture obligation to walk in His footsteps
and imbibe His Spirit, for &ldquo;if any man have not the
<i>Spirit of Christ</i>, he is <i>none of His</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, that each individual Christian were more Saviour-like!
that, in the manifestation of a holy character and
heavenly demeanor, it might be said in some feeble
measure of the faint and imperfect reflection&mdash;&ldquo;Such was
<i>Jesus</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How far short we are of such a criterion, mournful experience
can testify. But it is at least comforting to
know that there is a day coming, when, in the full vision
and fruition of the Glorious Original, the exhortation of
our motto-verse will be needed no more; when we shall
be able to say, in the words of an inspired apostle,</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;We <i>have</i> the <span class="smcap">mind of Christ</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>COMPASSION.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;I have compassion on the multitude.&rdquo;&mdash;Mark, viii. 2.</p>

<p>What a pattern to His people, the tender
<i>compassion</i> of Jesus! He found the world He
came to save a moral Bethesda. The wail of
suffering humanity was every where borne to
His ear. It was His delight to walk its
porches, to pity, relieve, comfort, save! The
faintest cry of misery arrested His footsteps&mdash;stirred
a ripple in this fountain of Infinite
Love. Was it a <i>leper</i>,&mdash;that dreaded name
which entailed a life-long exile from friendly
looks and kindly words? There was <i>One</i>, at
least, who had tones and deeds of tenderness
for the outcast. &ldquo;<i>Jesus</i>, being moved with
compassion, put forth His hand, and <i>touched</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
him.&rdquo; Was it some blind beggars on the
Jericho highway, groping in darkness, pleading
for help? &ldquo;<i>Jesus</i> stood still, and had
compassion on them, and touched their eyes!&rdquo;
Was it the speechless pleadings of a widow&#8217;s
tears at the gate of Nain, when she followed
her earthly pride and prop to the grave?
&ldquo;When the <i>Lord</i> saw her, He had compassion
on her, and said, Weep not!&rdquo; Even when
He rebukes, the bow of compassion is seen in
the cloud, or rather, that cloud, as it passes,
dissolves in a rain-shower of mercy. He
pronounces Jerusalem &ldquo;<i>desolate</i>,&rdquo; but the
doom is uttered amid a flood of anguished
sorrow!</p>

<p>Reader! do the compassionate words and
deeds of a tender Saviour find any feeble echo
and transcript in yours? As you traverse in
thought the wastes of human wretchedness,
does the spectacle give rise, not to the mere
emotional feeling which weeps itself away in
sentimental tears, but to an earnest desire to
<i>do something</i> to mitigate the sufferings of woe-worn
humanity? How vast and world-wide the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
claims on your compassion!&mdash;now near, now at
a distance&mdash;the unmet and unanswered cry of
perishing millions abroad&mdash;the heathendom
which lies unsuccored at your own door&mdash;the
public charity languishing&mdash;the mission staff
dwarfed and crippled from lack of needful
funds&mdash;a suffering district&mdash;a starving family&mdash;a
poor neighbor&mdash;a helpless orphan&mdash;it may
be, some crowded hovel, where misery and
vice run riot&mdash;or some lonely sick chamber,
where the dim lamp has been wasting for
dreary nights&mdash;or some desolate home which
death has entered, where &ldquo;Joseph is not, and
Simeon is not,&rdquo; and where some sobbing heart,
under the tattered garb of poverty, mourns,
unsolaced and unpitied, its &ldquo;loved and lost.&rdquo;
Are there none such within your reach, to
whom a trifling pittance would be as an angel
of mercy? How it would hallow and enhance
all you possess, were you to seek to live as
almoner of Jehovah&#8217;s bounties! If He has
given you of this world&#8217;s substance, remember
it is bestowed, not to be greedily hoarded or
lavishly squandered. Property and wealth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
are talents to be traded on and laid out for
the good of others&mdash;sacred trusts, not selfishly
to be <i>enjoyed</i>, but generously to be <i>employed</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor are the representatives of Jesus,
their wants He considers as His own,&rdquo; and He
will recompense accordingly. The feeblest
expression of Christian pity and love, though
it be but the widow&#8217;s mite, or the cup of cold
water, or the kindly look and word when
there is neither mite nor cup to give, yet, if
done in <i>His</i> name, it is entered in the &ldquo;book
of life&rdquo; as a &ldquo;loan to the Lord;&rdquo; and in that
day when &ldquo;the books are opened,&rdquo; the loan
will be paid back with usury.</p>

<p class="arm">&ldquo;ARM YOURSELVES LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME MIND.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>RESIGNATION IN TRIAL.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Not my will, but Thine be done!&rdquo;&mdash;Luke, xxii. 42.</p>

<p>Where was there ever resignation like
this! The life of Jesus was one long martyrdom.
From Bethlehem&#8217;s manger to Calvary&#8217;s
cross, there was scarce one break in the clouds;
these gathered more darkly and ominously
around Him till they burst over His devoted
head as He uttered His expiring cry. Yet
throughout this pilgrimage of sorrow no murmuring
accent escaped His lips. The most
suffering of all suffering lives was one of uncomplaining
submission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not <i>my</i> will, but <i>Thy</i> will,&rdquo; was the motto
of this wondrous Being! When He came
into the world He thus announced His advent,
&ldquo;Lo, I come, I delight to do <i>Thy will</i>, O my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
God!&rdquo; When He left it, we listen to the
same prayer of blended agony and acquiescence,
&ldquo;O my Father, if it be possible let this
cup pass from me! <i>Nevertheless</i> not as <i>I will</i>,
but as <i>Thou wilt</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! is this mind also in <i>you</i>? Ah,
what are your trials compared to His! What
the ripples in your tide of woe, compared to
the waves and billows which swept over him!
If He, the spotless Lamb of God, &ldquo;murmured
not,&rdquo; how can <i>you</i> murmur? <i>His</i> were the
sufferings of a bosom never once darkened
with the passing shadow of guilt or sin. <i>Your</i>
severest sufferings are deserved, yea, infinitely
less <i>than</i> deserved! Are you tempted to indulge
in hard suspicions, as to God&#8217;s faithfulness
and love, in appointing some peculiar
trial? Ask yourself, Would Jesus have done
<i>this</i>? Should <i>I</i> seek to pry into &ldquo;the deep
things of God,&rdquo; when <i>He</i>, in the spirit of a
weaned child, was satisfied with the solution,
&ldquo;<i>Even so, Father, for so it seems good in Thy
sight</i>&rdquo;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so, <i>Father</i>!&rdquo; Afflicted one! &ldquo;tossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
with tempest, and not comforted,&rdquo; take that
<i>word</i> on which thy Lord pillowed His suffering
head, and make it, as He did, the secret
of thy resignation.</p>

<p>The sick child will take the bitterest
draught from a <i>father&#8217;s</i> hand. &ldquo;This cup
which Thou, O God, givest me to drink, shall
I not drink it?&rdquo; Be it mine to lie passive in
the arms of Thy chastening love, exulting in
the assurance that all Thy appointments,
though sovereign, are never arbitrary, but
that there is a gracious &ldquo;need be&rdquo; in them all.
&ldquo;My Father!&rdquo; my Covenant God! the God
who <i>spared not Jesus</i>! It may well hush
every repining word.</p>

<p>Drinking deep of his sweet spirit of submission,
you will be able thus to meet, yea, even
to welcome, your sorest cross, saying, &ldquo;Yes,
Lord, all <i>is</i> well, just because it is Thy blessed
will. Take me, use me, chasten me, as
seemeth good in Thy sight. My will is resolved
into Thine. This trial is dark; I can
not see the &lsquo;why and the wherefore&rsquo; of it&mdash;but
&lsquo;not my will, but Thy will!&rsquo; The gourd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
is withered; I can not see the reason of so
speedy a dissolution of the loved earthly shelter;
sense and sight ask in vain why these
leaves of earthly refreshment have been
doomed so soon to droop in sadness and sorrow.
But it is enough. &lsquo;The Lord prepared
the worm;&rsquo; &lsquo;not <i>my</i> will, but <i>Thy</i>
will!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, how does the stricken soul honor God
by thus being <i>dumb</i> in the midst of dark and
perplexing dealings, recognizing in these, part
of the needed discipline and training for a
sorrowless, sinless, deathless world; regarding
every trial as a link in the chain which draws
it to heaven, where the whitest robes will be
found to be those here baptized with suffering,
and bathed in tears!</p>

<p class="arm">&ldquo;ARM YOURSELVES LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME MIND.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>DEVOTEDNESS TO GOD.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Wist ye not that I must be about my Father&#8217;s
business?&rdquo;&mdash;Luke, ii. 49.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My meat and my drink are to do the will
of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.&rdquo;
That <i>one</i> object brought Jesus from heaven&mdash;that
<i>one</i> object he pursued with unflinching,
undeviating constancy, until He could say,
&ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However short man comes of <i>his</i> &ldquo;chief
end,&rdquo; &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest&rdquo; was the
motive, the rule, and exponent of every act
of that wondrous life. With us, the magnet
of the soul, even when truest, is ever subject
to partial oscillations and depressions, trembling
at times away from its great attraction-point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<i>His</i> never knew one tremulous wavering
from its all-glorious center. With Him
there were no ebbs and flows, no fits and
starts. He could say, in the words of that
prophetic psalm which speaks so pre&euml;minently
of Himself, &ldquo;I have set the Lord <i>always</i> before
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! do you feel that in some feeble
measure this lofty life-motto of the sinless Son
of God is written on your home and heart,
regulating your actions, chastening your joys,
quickening your hopes, giving energy and
direction to your whole being, subordinating
all the affections of your nature to their high
destiny? With pure and unalloyed motives,
with a single eye, and a single aim, can you
say, somewhat in the spirit of His brightest
follower, &ldquo;This <i>one</i> thing I do&rdquo;? Are you
ready to regard all you have&mdash;rank, name,
talents, riches, influence, distinctions&mdash;valuable,
only so far as they contribute to promote
the glory of Him who is &ldquo;first and last, and
all in all&rdquo;? Seek to feel that your heavenly
Father&#8217;s is not only <i>a</i> business; but <i>the</i> business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of life. &ldquo;Whose I am, and whom I
serve,&rdquo;&mdash;let this be the superscription written
on your thoughts and deeds, your employments
and enjoyments, your sleeping and
waking. Be not, as the fixed stars, cold and
distant; but be ever bathing in the sunshine
of conscious nearness to Him who is the sun
and center of all happiness and joy.</p>

<p>Each has some appointed work to perform,
some little niche in the spiritual temple to
occupy. Yours may be no splendid services,
no flaming or brilliant actions to blaze and
dazzle in the eye of man. It may be the
quiet, unobtrusive inner work, the secret
prayer, the mortified sin, the forgiven injury,
the trifling act of self-sacrifice for God&#8217;s glory
and the good of others, of which no eye but
the Eye which seeth in secret is cognizant.
It matters not how <i>small</i>. Remember, with
Him, motive dignifies action. It is not <i>what</i>
we do, but <i>how</i> we do it. He can be glorified
in <i>little</i> things as well as <i>great</i> things, and by
nothing more than the daily walk, the daily
life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Beware of any thing that would interfere
with a surrender of heart and soul to His
service&mdash;worldly entanglements, indulged sin,
an uneven walk, a divided heart, nestling in
creature comforts, shrinking from the cross.
How many hazard, if they do not make shipwreck,
of their eternal hopes by becoming
<i>idlers</i> in the vineyard; lingerers, like Lot;
world-lovers, like Demas; &ldquo;do-nothing Christians,&rdquo;
like the inhabitants of Meroz! The
command is, &ldquo;Go, work!&rdquo; <i>Words</i> tell what
you <i>should</i> be; <i>deeds</i> tell what you <i>are</i>. Let
those around you see there is a reality in
walking <i>with</i> God, and working <i>for</i> God!</p>

<h4>FORGIVENESS OF INJURIES.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they
know not what they do.&rdquo;&mdash;Luke, xxiii. 34.</p>

<p>Many a death-struggle has been made to
save a friend. A dying Saviour gathers up
His expiring breath to plead for His foes!
At the climax of His own woe, and of
human ingratitude&mdash;man-forsaken, and God-deserted&mdash;His
faltering voice mingles with
the shout of His murderers,&mdash;&ldquo;Father, forgive
them; for they know not what they
do!&rdquo; Had the faithless Peter been there,
could he have wondered at the reply to a
former question,&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, how often shall my
brother sin against me, and I forgive him,&mdash;till
seven times?&rdquo; Jesus said unto him, &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
say not unto thee, Until seven times; but,
Until seventy times seven.&rdquo; (Matt. xviii. 21.)</p>

<p>Superiority to insult and ignominy, with
some, proceeds from a callous and indifferent
temperament,&mdash;a cold, phlegmatic, stoical insensibility,
alike to kindness or unkindness.
It was not so with Jesus. The tender sensibilities
of His holy nature rendered Him
keenly sensible to ingratitude and injury,
whether this was manifested in the malice
of undisguised enmity, or the treachery of
trusted friendship. Perhaps to a noble nature
the latter of these is the more deeply wounding.
Many are inclined to forgive an open
and unmasked antagonist, who are not so
willing to forget or forgive heartless faithfulness,
or unrequited love. But see, too, in
this respect, the conduct of the blessed Redeemer!
Mark how He deals with His own
disciples who had basely forsaken him and
fled, and that, too, in the hour He most
needed their sympathy. No sooner does He
rise from the dead than He hastens to disarm
their fears and to assure them of an unaltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and unalterable affection. &ldquo;Go tell <i>my
brethren</i>,&rdquo; is the first message He sends;
&ldquo;<i>Peace be unto you</i>,&rdquo; is the salutation at the
first meeting; &ldquo;<i>Children!</i>&rdquo; is the word with
which He first greets them on the shores of Tiberias.
Even Joseph, (the Old Testament type
and pattern of generous forgiveness,) when he
makes himself known to his brethren, recalls
the bitter thought, &ldquo;Whom ye sold into
Egypt.&rdquo; The true Joseph, when <i>He</i> reveals
Himself to His disciples, buries in oblivion
the memory of by-gone faithlessness. He
<i>meets</i> them with a benediction. He <i>leaves</i>
them at His ascension with the same&mdash;&ldquo;He
lifted up His hands and blessed them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! follow in all this the spirit of your
Lord and Master. In rising from the study
of His holy example, seek to feel that with
you there shall be no such name, no such
word, as <i>enemy</i>! Harbor no resentful thought,
indulge in no bitter recrimination. Surrender
yourself to no sullen fretfulness. Let &ldquo;the
law of kindness&rdquo; be in your heart. Put the
best construction on the failings of others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Make no injurious comments on their frailties;
no uncharitable insinuations. &ldquo;Consider thyself,
lest thou also be tempted.&rdquo; When
disposed at any time to cherish an unforgiving
spirit towards a brother, think, if thy God
had retained His anger for ever, where wouldst
thou have been? If <i>He</i>, the Infinite One,
who might have spurned thee for ever from
His presence, hath had patience with thee,
and forgiven thee <i>all</i>, wilt <i>thou</i>, on account of
some petty grievance which thy calmer moments
would pronounce unworthy of a thought,
indulge in the look of cold estrangement, the
unrelenting word, or unforgiving deed? &ldquo;If
any man have a quarrel against any, even as
Christ forgave you, so also do ye.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>MEEKNESS.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;I am meek and lowly in heart.&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. xi. 29.</p>

<p>There is often a beautiful blending of
majesty and humility, magnanimity and lowliness,
in great minds. The mightiest and
holiest of all Beings that ever trod our world
was the meekest of all. The Ancient of
Days was as the &ldquo;infant of days.&rdquo; He who
had listened to nothing but angel-melodies
from all eternity, found, while on earth,
melody in the lispings of an infant&#8217;s voice,
or in an outcast&#8217;s tears! No wonder an innocent
<i>lamb</i> was His emblem, or that the
annointing Spirit came down upon Him in
the form of the gentle <i>dove</i>. He had the
wealth of worlds at His feet. The hosts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
heaven had only to be summoned as His
retinue. But all the pageantry of the world,
all its dreams of carnal glory, had, for Him,
no fascination. The Tempter, from a mountain-summit,
showed Him a wide scene of
&ldquo;splendid misery;&rdquo; but He spurned alike the
thought and the adversary away! John and
James would call down fire from heaven on a
Samaritan village; He rebukes the vengeful
suggestion! Peter, on the night of the betrayal,
cuts off the ear of an assassin; the
intended Victim, again, only challenges His
disciple, and heals His enemy!</p>

<p>Arraigned before Pilate&#8217;s judgment-seat,
how meekly He bears nameless wrongs and
indignities! Suspended on the cross&mdash;the
execrations of the multitude are rising around,
but He hears as though He heard them
not; they extract no angry look, no bitter
word&mdash;&ldquo;Behold the <i>Lamb</i> of God!&rdquo; Need
we wonder that &ldquo;meekness&rdquo; and &ldquo;poverty
of spirit&rdquo; should stand foremost in His own
cluster of beatitudes; that He should select
<i>this</i> among all His other qualities for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
peculiar study and imitation of His disciples,
&ldquo;Learn of Me, <i>for</i> I am <i>meek</i>;&rdquo; or that an
apostle should exhort &ldquo;by the <i>meekness</i> and
<i>gentleness</i> of Christ!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How different the world&#8217;s maxims, and His!
The <i>world&#8217;s</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Resent the affront, vindicate
honor!&rdquo; <i>His</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Overcome evil with good!&rdquo;
<i>The world&#8217;s</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Only let it be when for your
<i>faults</i> ye are buffeted that ye take it patiently.&rdquo;
<i>His</i>&mdash;&ldquo;When ye do <i>well</i> and suffer for it, ye
take it patiently, <i>this</i> is acceptable with God.&rdquo;
(1 Pet. ii. 20.)</p>

<p>Reader! strive to obtain, like your adorable
Lord, this &ldquo;ornament of a meek and quiet
spirit, which, in the sight of God, is of great
price.&rdquo; Be &ldquo;clothed&rdquo; with gentleness and
humility. Follow not the world&#8217;s fleeting
shadows that mock you as you grasp them.
If always aspiring&mdash;ever soaring on the
wing&mdash;you are likely to become discontented,
proud, selfish, time-serving. In whatever
position of life God has placed you, be
satisfied. What! ambitious to be on a pinnacle
of the temple&mdash;a higher place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Church, or in the world?&mdash;Satan might hurl
you down! &ldquo;Be not high-minded, but fear.&rdquo;
And with respect to others, honor their gifts,
contemplate their excellences only to imitate
them. Speak kindly, act gently, &ldquo;condescend
to men of low estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Be assured, no happiness is equal to that
enjoyed by the &ldquo;<i>meek Christian</i>.&rdquo; He has
within him a perpetual inner sunshine, a
perennial well-spring of peace. Never ruffled
and fretted by real or imagined injuries, he
puts the best construction on motives and
actions, and by a gentle answer to unmerited
reproach often disarms wrath.</p>

<h4>THANKFULNESS.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.&rdquo;&mdash;Matt.
xi. 25.</p>

<p>A thankful spirit pervaded the entire
life of Jesus, and surrounded with a heavenly
halo His otherwise darkened path. In moments
we least expect to find it, this beauteous
ray breaks through the gloom. In
instituting the memorial of His <i>death</i>, He
&ldquo;<i>gave thanks</i>!&rdquo; Even in crossing the
Kedron to Gethsemane, &ldquo;He sang an
hymn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We know in seasons of deep sorrow and
trial that every thing wears a gloomy aspect.
Dumb Nature herself to the burdened spirit
seems as if she partook in the hues of sadness.
The life of Jesus was one continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
experience of privation and woe&mdash;a &ldquo;Valley
of Baca,&rdquo; from first to last; yet, amid
accents of plaintive sorrow, there are ever
heard subdued undertones of <i>thankfulness</i>
and joy!</p>

<p>Ah, if He, the suffering &ldquo;Man of sorrows,&rdquo;
could, during a life of unparalleled
woe, lift up His heart in grateful acknowledgment
to His Father in heaven, how
ought the lives of those to be one perpetual
&ldquo;hymn of thankfulness,&rdquo; who are from day
to day and hour to hour (for all they have,
both temporally and spiritually) pensioners
on God&#8217;s bounty and love!</p>

<p>Reader! cultivate this thankful spirit;
it will be to thee a perpetual feast. There
is, or ought to be, with us no such thing as
<i>small</i> mercies; all are <i>great</i>, because the least
are undeserved. Indeed, a really thankful
heart will extract motive for gratitude from
every thing, making the most even of scanty
blessings. St. Paul, when in his dungeon at
Rome, a prisoner in chains, is heard to say,
&ldquo;I have <i>all</i>, and abound!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Guard, on the other hand, against that
spirit of continual fretting and moping over
fancied ills; that temptation to exaggerate
the real or supposed disadvantages of
our condition, magnifying the trifling inconveniences
of every-day life into enormous
evils. Think, rather, how much we have to
be thankful for. The world in which we
live, in spite of all the scars of sin and suffering
upon it, is a happy world. It is not, as
many would morbidly paint it, flooded with
tears and strewn with wrecks, plaintive with
a perpetual dirge of sorrow. True, the
&ldquo;Everlasting Hills&rdquo; are in glory, but there
are numberless eminences of grace, and love,
and mercy below; many green spots in the
lower valley, <i>many more than we deserve</i>!</p>

<p>God will reward a thankful spirit. Just
as on earth, when a man receives with gratitude
what is given, we are more disposed to
give again, so also, &ldquo;the <i>Lord</i> loveth&rdquo; a
cheerful &ldquo;receiver,&rdquo; as well as a cheerful
&ldquo;giver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let ours, moreover, be a <i>Gospel</i> thankfulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Let the incense of a grateful spirit rise
not only to the Great Giver of all good, but
to our Covenant God in Christ. Let it be the
spirit of the child exulting in the bounty and
beneficence of his <i>Father&#8217;s</i> house and home!
&ldquo;Giving <i>thanks</i> always for all things unto
God and <i>the Father</i>, in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the sweet melody of gratitude vibrates
through every successive moment of
our daily being, let love to our adorable Redeemer
show for <i>whom</i> and for <i>what</i> it is we
reserve our notes of loftiest and most fervent
praise. Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable
gift!</p>

<h4>UNSELFISHNESS.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;For even Christ pleased not Himself.&rdquo;&mdash;Rom. xv. 8.</p>

<p>Too legibly are the characters written on
the fallen heart and a fallen world&mdash;&ldquo;All
seek their own!&rdquo; Selfishness is the great law
of our degenerated nature. When the love
of God was dethroned from the soul, self
vaulted into the vacant seat, and there, in
some one of its Proteus shapes, continues to
reign.</p>

<p>Jesus stands out for our imitation a grand
solitary exception in the midst of a world of
selfishness. His entire life was one abnegation
of self; a beautiful living embodiment of
that charity which &ldquo;seeketh not her own.&rdquo;
He who for others turned water into wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and provided a miraculous supply for the
fainting thousands in the wilderness, exerted
no such miraculous power for His own necessities.
During His forty days&#8217; temptation, no
table did He spread for Himself, no booth did
He rear for his unpillowed head. Twice do
we read of Him shedding tears&mdash;on neither
occasion were they for Himself. The approach
of His cross and passion, instead of
absorbing Him in His own approaching suffering,
seemed only to elicit new and more gracious
promises to His people. When His
enemies came to apprehend Him, His only
stipulation was for His disciples&#8217; release&mdash;&ldquo;Let
these go their way.&rdquo; In the very act of
departure, with all the boundless glories of
eternity in sight, <i>they</i> were still all His care.</p>

<p>Ah, how different is the spirit of the world!
With how many is day after day only a new
oblation to that idol which never darkened
with its shadow His Holy heart; pampering
their own wishes; &ldquo;envying and grieving at
the good of a neighbor;&rdquo; unable to brook the
praise of a rival; establishing their own reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
on the ruins of another; thus engendering
jealousy, discontent, peevishness, and every
kindred unholy passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But ye have not so learned Christ!&rdquo;
Reader! have you been sitting at the feet of
Him who &ldquo;pleased not Himself&rdquo;? Are you
&ldquo;dying daily;&rdquo;&mdash;dying to self as well as to
sin? Are you animated with <i>this</i> as the
high end and aim of existence&mdash;to lay out
your time, and talents, and opportunities, for
God&#8217;s glory, and the good of your fellow-men;
not seeking your own interests, but rather
ceding these, if, by doing so, another will be
made happier, and your Saviour honored?
You may not have it in your power to manifest
this &ldquo;mind of Jesus&rdquo; on a great scale,
by enduring great sacrifices; nor is this required.
His denial of self had about it no
repulsive austerity; but you can evince its
holy influence and sway by innumerable little
offices of kindness and good-will; taking a
generous interest in the welfare and pursuits
of others, or engaging and co&ouml;perating in
schemes for the mitigation of human misery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Avoid <i>ostentation</i>&mdash;another repulsive form
of self. Be willing to be in the shade; sound
no trumpet before you. The evangelist
Matthew made a great feast, which was graced
by the presence of Jesus; in his Gospel he
says not one word about it!</p>

<p>Seek to live more constantly and habitually
under the constraining influence of the love
of Jesus. Selfishness withers and dies beneath
Calvary.</p>

<p>Ah, believer! if Christ had &ldquo;pleased Himself,&rdquo;
where wouldst <i>thou</i> have <i>been</i> this day?</p>

<h4>SUBMISSION TO GOD&#8217;S WORD.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Jesus said unto him, It is written.&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. iv. 7.</p>

<p>We can not fail to be struck, in the course
of the Saviour&#8217;s public teaching, with His
constant appeal to the word of God. While,
at times, He utters, in His own name, the
authoritative behest, &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say
unto you,&rdquo; He as often thus introduces some
mighty work, or gives intimation of some impending
event in His own momentous life,
&ldquo;These things must come to pass, that <i>the
Scriptures be fulfilled, which saith</i>.&rdquo; He commands
His people to &ldquo;search the Scriptures;&rdquo;
but He sets the example by searching and
submitting to them Himself. Whether he
drives the money-changers from their sacrilegious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
traffic in the temple, or foils his great
adversary on the mount of temptation, he
does so with the same weapon, &ldquo;<i>It is written.</i>&rdquo;
When He rises from the grave, the theme of
His first discourse is one impressive tribute to
the value and authority of the same sacred
oracles. The disciples on the road to Emmaus
listen to nothing but a <i>Bible lesson</i>. &ldquo;He expounded
unto them in all <i>the Scriptures</i> the
things concerning Himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How momentous the instruction herein
conveyed! The necessity of the absolute
subjection of the mind to God&#8217;s written Word&mdash;making
churches, creeds, ministers, books,
religious opinion, all subordinate and subservient
to this&mdash;&ldquo;How readest thou?&rdquo; rebuking
the philosophy, falsely so called, that
would distort the plain statements of Revelation,
and bring them to the bar of proud
Reason.</p>

<p>If an infallible Redeemer, &ldquo;a law to Himself,&rdquo;
was submissive in all respects to the
&ldquo;<i>written</i> law,&rdquo; shall fallible man refuse to sit
with the teachableness of a little child, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
listen to the Divine message? There may be,
there <i>is</i>, in the Bible, what reason staggers at:
&ldquo;we have nothing to draw with, and the well
is deep.&rdquo; But, &ldquo;<i>Thus saith the Lord</i>,&rdquo; is
enough. Faith does not first ask what the
bread is made of, but <i>eats</i> it. It does not
analyse the components of the living stream,
but with joy draws the water from &ldquo;the wells
of salvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! take that Word as &ldquo;the lamp to
thy feet, and the light to thy path.&rdquo; In days
when false lights are hung out, there is the
more need of keeping the eye steadily fixed
on the unerring beacon. Make the Bible the
arbiter in all difficulties&mdash;the ultimate court
of appeal. Like Mary, &ldquo;sit at the feet of
Jesus,&rdquo; willing only to learn of Him. How
many perplexities it would save you! how
many fatal steps in life it would prevent&mdash;how
many tears! &ldquo;It is a great matter,&rdquo; says the
noblest of modern Christian philosophers,
&ldquo;when the mind dwells on any passage of
Scripture, just to think <i>how true it is</i>.&rdquo;
(<i>Chalmers&#8217; Life</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>In every dubious question, when the foot is
trembling on debatable ground, knowing not
whether to advance or recede, make this the
final criterion, &ldquo;What saith the Scripture?&rdquo;
The world may remonstrate&mdash;erring friends
may disapprove&mdash;Satan may tempt&mdash;ingenious
arguments may explain away; but, with our
finger on the revealed page, let the words of
our Great Example be ever a Divine formula
for our guidance:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>This</i> commandment have
I received of my Father!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>PRAYERFULNESS.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;He continued all night in prayer to God.&rdquo;&mdash;Luke,
vi. 12.</p>

<p>We speak of <i>this</i> Christian and <i>that</i> Christian
as &ldquo;a man of prayer.&rdquo; Jesus was emphatically
so. The Spirit was &ldquo;poured upon
Him without measure,&rdquo; yet&mdash;<i>He prayed</i>! He
was incarnate wisdom, &ldquo;needing not that any
should teach Him.&rdquo; He was infinite in His
power, and boundless in His resources, yet&mdash;<i>He
prayed</i>! How deeply sacred the prayerful
memories that hover around the solitudes of
Olivet and the shores of Tiberias! He seemed
often to turn night into day to redeem moments
for prayer, rather than lose the blessed privilege.</p>

<p>We are rarely, indeed, admitted into the
solemnities of His inner life. The veil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
night is generally between us and the Great
High Priest, when He entered &ldquo;the holiest of
all;&rdquo; but we have enough to reveal the depth
and fervor, the tenderness and confidingness
of this blissful intercommunion with His
heavenly Father. No morning dawns without
His fetching fresh manna from the mercy-seat.
&ldquo;He wakeneth morning by morning; He
wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.&rdquo;
(Isa. l. 4). Beautiful description!&mdash;a praying
Redeemer, wakening, as if at early dawn, the
ear of His Father, to get fresh supplies for
the duties and the trials of the day! All His
public acts were consecrated by prayer,&mdash;His
baptism, His transfiguration, His miracles,
His agony, His death. He breathed away
His spirit in prayer. &ldquo;His last breath,&rdquo; says
Philip Henry, &ldquo;was praying breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How sweet to think, in holding communion
with God&mdash;<i>Jesus</i> drank of this very brook!
He consecrated the bended knee and the silent
chamber. He refreshed His fainting spirit at
the same great Fountain-head from which it is
life for us to draw and death to forsake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Reader! do you complain of your languid
spirit, your drooping faith, your fitful affections,
your lukewarm love? May you not
trace much of what you deplore to an unfrequented
chamber? The treasures are locked
up from you, because you have suffered the
key to rust; the hands hang down because
they have ceased to be uplifted in prayer.
Without prayer!&mdash;It is the pilgrim without a
staff&mdash;the seaman without a compass&mdash;the
soldier going unarmed and unharnessed to
battle.</p>

<p>Beware of encouraging what indisposes to
prayer&mdash;going to the audience chamber with
soiled garments, the din of the world following
you, its distracting thoughts hovering unforbidden
over your spirit. Can you wonder
that the living water refuses to flow through
obstructed channels, or the heavenly light to
pierce murky vapors!</p>

<p>On earth, fellowship with a lofty order of
minds imparts a certain nobility to the
character; so, in a far higher sense, by communion
with God you will be transformed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
into His image, and get assimilated to His
likeness. Make every event in life a reason
for fresh going to Him. If difficulted in
duty, bring it to the test of prayer. If
bowed down with anticipated trial,&mdash;&ldquo;fearing
to enter the cloud,&rdquo;&mdash;remember Christ&#8217;s
preparation, &ldquo;Sit ye here while I go and
<i>pray</i> yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let prayer consecrate every thing&mdash;your
time, talents, pursuits, engagements, joys,
sorrows, crosses, losses. By it, rough paths
will be made smooth, trials disarmed of their
bitterness, enjoyments hallowed and refined,
the bread of the world turned into angels&#8217;

<h4>LOVE TO THE BRETHREN.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us.&rdquo;&mdash;Eph.
v. 2.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; says a writer, &ldquo;came from heaven
on the wings of love.&rdquo; It was the element
in which he moved and walked. He sought
to baptize the world afresh with it. When
we find Him teaching us by love to vanquish
an <i>enemy</i>, we need not wonder at the tenderness
of His appeals to the <i>brethren</i> to &ldquo;love
one another.&rdquo; Like a fond father impressing
his children, how the Divine Teacher lingers
over the lesson, &ldquo;This is <i>My</i> commandment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If selfishness had guided His actions, we
might have expected him to demand all His
people&#8217;s love for himself. But He claims no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
such monopoly. He not only encourages
mutual affection, but He makes it the badge
of discipleship! He gives them at once its
measure and motive. &ldquo;Love one another,
as I have loved you!&rdquo; What a love was
that!&mdash;it reached to the lowliest and humblest,&mdash;&ldquo;Inasmuch
as ye did it to the <i>least</i> of
these, ye did it unto <i>Me</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah! if such was the Elder Brother&#8217;s love
to His younger brethren, what should the
love of these younger brothers be for one
another! How humbling that there should
be so much that is sadly and strangely unlike
the spirit which our blessed Master sought to
inculcate alike by precept and example! Individual
Christians, why these bitter estrangements,
these censorious words, these harsh
judgments, this want of kind consideration
of the feelings and failings of those who may
differ from you? Why are your friendships
so often like the summer brook, soon dried?
You hope, ere long, to meet in glory. Doubtless
when you enter on that &ldquo;sabbath of
love,&rdquo; many a greeting will be this, &ldquo;Alas!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
my brother, that on earth I did not love thee
more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do you see the image of God in a professing
believer? It is your duty to love him
for the sake of that image. No church, no
outward livery, no denominational creed,
should prevent your owning and claiming
him as a fellow-pilgrim and fellow-heir. It
has been said of a portrait, however poor the
painting, however unfinished the style, however
faulty the touches, however coarse and
unseemly the frame, yet if the <i>likeness</i> be
faithful, we overlook many subordinate defects.
So it is with the Christian: however
plain the exterior, however rough the setting,
or even manifold the blemishes still found
cleaving to a partially-sanctified nature, yet
if the Redeemer&#8217;s <i>likeness</i> be feebly and
faintly traced there, we should love the copy
for the sake of the Divine Original. There
may be other bonds of association and intercourse
linking spirit with spirit; family ties,
mental congenialities, intellectual tastes, philanthropic
pursuits; but that which ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
take the precedence of all, is the love of God&#8217;s
image in the brethren. What will heaven be
but this love perfected&mdash;loving Christ, and
beloved by those who love Him?</p>

<p>Reader! seek to love <i>Him</i> more, and you
will love His people more. John had more
love than the other disciples. Why? He
drank deepest of the love within that Bosom
on which he delighted to lean, every beat of
which was love. &ldquo;Walk,&rdquo; then, &ldquo;in love!&rdquo;
Let it be the very foot-road you tread; let
your way to heaven be paved with it. Soon
shall we come to look within the portal.
Then shall every jarring and dissonant note
be merged into the sublime harmonies of
&ldquo;the new heavens and the new earth,&rdquo; and
we shall all &ldquo;see eye to eye!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>SYMPATHY.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Jesus wept.&rdquo;&mdash;John, xi. 35.</p>

<p>It is an affecting thing to see a Great man
in tears! &ldquo;<i>Jesus wept!</i>&rdquo; It was ever His
delight to tread in the footsteps of sorrow&mdash;to
heal the broken-hearted&mdash;turning aside from
His own path of suffering to &ldquo;weep with
those that weep.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Bethany!</i> That scene, that <i>word</i>, is a condensed
volume of consolation for yearning
and desolate hearts. What a majesty in those
tears! He had just been discoursing on Himself
as the Resurrection and the Life&mdash;the
next moment He is a Weeping Man by a
human grave, melted in anguished sorrow at
a bereaved one&#8217;s side! Think of the funeral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
at the gate of Nain, reading its lesson to dejected
myriads&mdash;&ldquo;Let thy widows trust in
me!&rdquo; Think of the farewell discourse to
His disciples, when, muffling all His own foreseen
and anticipated sorrows, He thought
only of soothing and mitigating theirs!
Think of the affecting pause in that silent
procession to Calvary, when He turns round
and stills the sobs of those who are tracking
His steps with their weeping! Think of that
wondrous epitome of human tenderness, just
ere His eyes closed in their sleep of agony&mdash;in
the mightiest crisis of all time&mdash;when filial
love looked down on an anguished mother,
and provided her a son and a home!</p>

<p>Ah, was there ever sympathy like this!
Son! Brother! Kinsman! Saviour! all in one!
The majesty of Godhead almost lost in the
tenderness of a Friend. But so it <i>was</i>, and so
it is. The heart of the now enthroned King
beats responsive to the humblest of His sorrow-stricken
people. &ldquo;I am poor and needy,
yet the Lord <i>carries me on His heart</i>!&rdquo; (margin.)</p>

<p>Let us &ldquo;go and do likewise.&rdquo; Let us be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
ready, like our Lord, to follow the beck of
misery,&mdash;&ldquo;to deliver the needy when he
crieth, the poor also, and him that hath no
helper.&rdquo; Sympathy costs but little. Its recompense
and return are great, in the priceless
consolation it imparts. Few there are who
undervalue it. Look at Paul&mdash;the weary,
jaded prisoner,&mdash;chained to a soldier&mdash;recently
wrecked, about to stand before C&aelig;sar.
He reaches Appii Forum and the Three
Taverns, dejected and depressed. Brethren
come from Rome, a distance of sixty miles, to
offer their <i>sympathy</i>. The aged man is cheered!
His spirit, like Jacob&#8217;s, &ldquo;revived!&rdquo;
&ldquo;He thanked God, and took courage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! let &ldquo;this mind,&rdquo; this holy, Christ-like
<i>habit</i> be in you, which was also in your
adorable Master. Delight, when opportunity
occurs, to frequent the house of mourning&mdash;to
bind up the widow&#8217;s heart, and to dry the orphan&#8217;s
tears. If you can do nothing else, you
can whisper into the ear of disconsolate sorrow
those majestic solaces, which, rising first
in the graveyard of Bethany, have sent their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
undying echoes through the world, and stirred
the depths of ten thousand hearts. &ldquo;Exercise
your souls,&rdquo; says Butler, &ldquo;in a loving sympathy
with sorrow in every form. Soothe it,
minister to it, succor it, revere it. It is the
relic of Christ in the world, an image of the
Great Sufferer, a shadow of the cross. It is
a holy and venerable thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jesus Himself &ldquo;<i>looked</i> for some to take <i>pity</i>,
but there was <i>none</i>; and for comforters, but
He found <i>none</i>!&rdquo; It shows how even <i>He</i>
valued sympathy, and that, too, in its commonest
form of &ldquo;<i>pity</i>,&rdquo; though an ungrateful
World denied it.</p>

<h4>FIDELITY IN REBUKE.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;The Lord turned and looked upon Peter.&rdquo;&mdash;Luke,
xxii. 61.</p>

<p>Jesus never spake one unnecessarily harsh
or severe word. He had a Divine sympathy
for the frailties and infirmities of a tried, and
suffering, and tempted nature in others. He
was forbearing to the ignorant, encouraging to
the weak, tender to the penitent, loving to
all,&mdash;yet how faithful was He as &ldquo;the Reprover
of sin!&rdquo; Silent under His own wrongs, with
what burning invectives did He lay bare the
Pharisees&#8217; masked corruption and hypocrisy!
When His Father&#8217;s name and temple were
profaned, how did He sweep, with an avenging
hand, the mammon-crowd away, replacing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
superscription, &ldquo;Holiness to the Lord,&rdquo; over
the defiled altars!</p>

<p>Nor was it different with His own disciples.
With what fidelity, when rebuke was needed,
did He administer it: the withering reprimand
conveyed sometimes by an impressive <i>word</i>
(Matt. xvi. 23); sometimes by a silent <i>look</i>
(Luke, xxii. 61). &ldquo;Faithful always were the
wounds of <i>this</i> Friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! art thou equally faithful with thy
Lord in rebuking evil; not with &ldquo;the wrath of
man, which worketh not the righteousness of
God,&rdquo; but with a holy jealousy of His glory,
feeling, with the sensitive honor of &ldquo;the good
soldier of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; that an affront offered
to Him is offered to thyself? The giving of
a wise reproof requires much Christian prudence
and delicate discretion. It is not by a
rash and inconsiderate exposure of failings
that we must attempt to reclaim an erring
brother. But neither, for the sake of a false
peace, must we compromise fidelity; even
friendship is too dearly purchased by winking
at sin. Perhaps, when Peter was led to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the Apostle who honestly reproved him, &ldquo;Our
beloved brother Paul,&rdquo; in nothing did he love
his rebuker more, than for the honest boldness
of his Christian reproof. If Paul had, in that
crisis of the Church, with a timidity unworthy
of him, evaded the ungracious task, what,
humanly speaking, might have been the
result?</p>

<p>How often does a seasonable reprimand, a
faithful caution, save a lifetime of sin and
sorrow! How many a death-bed has made the
disclosure, &ldquo;That kind warning of my friend
put an arrest on my career of guilt; it altered
my whole being; it brought me to the cross,
touched my heart, and, by God&#8217;s grace, saved
my soul!&rdquo; On the other hand, how many
have felt, when death has put his impressive
seal on some close earthly intimacy, &ldquo;This
friend, or that friend,&mdash;I might have spoken a
solemn word to him; but now he is no more;
the opportunity is lost, never to be recalled!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! see that you act not the spiritual
coward. When tempted to sit silent when
the name of God is slighted or dishonored,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
think, <i>would Jesus have done so</i>?&mdash;would <i>He</i>
have allowed the oath to go unrebuked&mdash;the
lie to be uttered unchallenged&mdash;the Sabbath
with impunity to be profaned? Where there
is a natural diffidence which makes you shrink
from a more bold and open reproof, remember
much may be done to discountenance sin, by
the silent holiness of demeanor which refuses
to smile at the unholy allusion or ribald jest.
&ldquo;A word spoken in due season, how good is
it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak gently,&rdquo; yet speak faithfully:
&ldquo;be pitiful&mdash;be courteous:&rdquo; yet &ldquo;quit you
like men; be strong!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>GENTLENESS IN REBUKE.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?&rdquo;&mdash;John, xxi. 15.</p>

<p>No word here of the erring disciple&#8217;s past
faithlessness;&mdash;his guilty cowardice&mdash;<i>unmentioned</i>;&mdash;his
base denial&mdash;his oaths&mdash;and
curses, and treacherous desertion&mdash;all <i>unmentioned</i>!
The memory of a threefold denial is
<i>suggested</i>, and no more, by the threefold
question of unutterable tenderness, &ldquo;Simon,
son of Jonas, lovest thou me?&rdquo; When Jesus
finds His disciples sleeping at the gate of
Gethsemane, He rebukes them; but how is
the rebuke disarmed of its poignancy by the
merciful apology which is added&mdash;&ldquo;The spirit
indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak!&rdquo; How
different from <i>their</i> unkind insinuation regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<i>Him</i>, when, in the vessel on Tiberias, &ldquo;He
was asleep&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Master carest thou not that
we perish!&rdquo; The woman of Samaria is full
of earthliness, carnality, sectarianism, guilt.
Yet how gently the Saviour speaks to her&mdash;how
forbearingly, yet faithfully. He directs
the arrow of conviction to that seared and
hardened conscience, till He lays it bleeding
at His feet! Truly, &ldquo;He will not break the
bruised reed&mdash;He will not quench the smoking
flax.&rdquo; By &ldquo;the <i>goodness</i> of God,&rdquo; He would
lead to repentance. When others are speaking
of merciless violence, He can dismiss the
most guilty of profligates with the words,
&ldquo;Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How many have an unholy pleasure in
finding a brother in the wrong&mdash;blazing
abroad his failings; administering rebuke, not
in gentle forbearance and kindly expostulation,
but with harsh and impatient severity!
How beautifully did Jesus unite intense sensibility
to sin, along with tenderest compassion
for the sinner, showing in this that &ldquo;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
knoweth our frame!&rdquo; Many a scholar needs
gentleness in chastisement. The reverse
would crush a sensitive spirit, or drive it to
despair. Jesus tenderly &ldquo;considers&rdquo; the case
of those He disciplines, &ldquo;tempering the wind
to the shorn lamb.&rdquo; In the picture of the
good shepherd bearing home the wandering
sheep, He illustrated by parable what He had
often and again taught by His own example.
No word of needless harshness or upbraiding
uttered to the erring wanderer! Ingratitude
is too deeply felt to need rebuke! In silent
love, &ldquo;He lays it on His shoulders rejoicing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! seek to mingle gentleness in all
your rebukes; bear with the infirmities of
others; make allowance for constitutional
frailties; never say harsh things, if kind
things will do as well; do not unnecessarily
lacerate with recalling former delinquencies.
In reproving another, let us rather feel how
much we need reproof ourselves. &ldquo;Consider
thyself,&rdquo; is a searching Scripture motto for
dealing with an erring brother. Remember
thy Lord&#8217;s method of silencing fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
accusation&mdash;&ldquo;Let him that is without sin cast the
first stone.&rdquo; Moreover, anger and severity
are not the successful means of reclaiming the
backslider, or of melting the obdurate. Like
the <i>smooth</i> stones with which David smote
Goliath, <i>gentle</i> rebukes are generally the most
powerful. The old fable of the traveller and
his cloak has a moral here as in other things.
The genial sunshine will effect its removal
sooner than the rough tempest. It was said
of Leighton, that &ldquo;he rebuked faults so
mildly, that they were never repeated, not
because the admonished were afraid, but
ashamed to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>ENDURANCE IN CONTRADICTION.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Who endured such contradiction of sinners against
Himself.&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. xii. 3.</p>

<p>What endurance was this! Perfect truth
in the midst of error; perfect love in the
midst of ingratitude and coldness; perfect
rectitude in the midst of perjury, violence,
fraud; perfect constancy in the midst of contumely
and desertion; perfect innocence, confronting
every debased form of depravity and
guilt; perfect patience, encountering every
species of gross provocation&mdash;&ldquo;oppressed and
afflicted, He opened not His mouth!&rdquo; &ldquo;For
my love&rdquo; (in return for my love), &ldquo;they are
mine adversaries; <i>but</i>&rdquo; (see His endurance!&mdash;the
only species of revenge of which His sinless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
nature was capable) &ldquo;<i>I give myself unto
prayer!</i>&rdquo; (Ps. cix. 4.)</p>

<p>Reader! &ldquo;let this mind be in you, which
was also in Christ Jesus!&rdquo; The greatest test
of an earthly soldier&#8217;s courage is <i>patient endurance</i>!
The noblest trait of the spiritual
soldier is the same. &ldquo;Having done all <i>to
stand</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;He <i>endured</i>, as seeing Him who is
invisible!&rdquo; Beware of the angry recrimination,
the hasty ebullition of temper. Amid
unkind insinuations&mdash;when motives are misrepresented,
and reputation assailed; when
good deeds are ridiculed, kind intentions
coldly thwarted and repulsed, chilling reserve
manifested where you expected nothing but
friendship&mdash;what a triumph over natural impulse
to manifest a spirit of meek endurance!&mdash;like
a rainbow, radiant with the hues of
heaven, resting peacefully amid the storms of
derision and &ldquo;the floods of ungodly men.&rdquo;
What an opportunity of magnifying the &ldquo;sustaining
grace of God!&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a small thing
for me to be judged of you, or of man&#8217;s judgment;
He that judgeth me is the Lord.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Lord is on my side; I will not fear
what man can do unto me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessed is the
man that <i>endureth</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;He that <i>endureth</i> to the
end, the same shall be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If faithful to our God, we must expect to
encounter contradiction in the same form
which Jesus did&mdash;&ldquo;the contradiction of <i>sinners</i>.&rdquo;
It has been well said, &ldquo;There is no cross of
nails and wood erected now for the Christian,
but there is one of words and looks which is
never taken down.&rdquo; If believers are set as
lights in the earth, lamps in the &ldquo;city of destruction,&rdquo;
we know that &ldquo;he that doeth evil
<i>hateth</i> the light.&rdquo; &ldquo;Marvel not, my brethren,
if the world hate you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Weary and faint ones, exposed to the shafts
of calumny and scorn because of your fidelity
to your God; encountering, it may be, the
coldness and estrangement of those dear to
you, who can not, perhaps, sympathize in the
holiness of your walk and the loftiness of
your aims, &ldquo;consider <i>Him</i> that endured such
contradiction of sinners against Himself, <i>lest</i>
ye be weary and faint in your minds!&rdquo; What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
is <i>your</i> &ldquo;contradiction&rdquo; to <i>His</i>? Soon your
cross, whatever it be, will have an end.
&ldquo;The seat of the scorner&rdquo; has no place in
yonder glorious heaven, where all will be
peace&mdash;no jarring note to disturb its blissful
harmonies! Look forward to the great coronation-day
of the Church triumphant,&mdash;the
day of your divine Lord&#8217;s appearing, when
motives and aims, now misunderstood, will be
vindicated, wrongs redressed, calumnies and
aspersions wiped away. Meanwhile, &ldquo;rejoice
that you are counted worthy to suffer shame
for His name.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>PLEASING GOD.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;I do always those things that please Him.&rdquo;&mdash;John, viii. 29.</p>

<p>What a glorious motto for a man&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I live
for God!</i>&rdquo; It is religion&#8217;s truest definition.
It is the essence of angelic bliss&mdash;the motive-principle
of angelic action; &ldquo;Ye ministers of
His, that do His pleasure.&rdquo; The Lord of
angels knew no higher, no <i>other</i> motive. It
was, during His incarnation, the regulator
and directory of His daily being. It supported
Him amid the depressing sorrows of
His woe-worn path. It upheld him in their
awful termination in the garden and on the
cross. For a moment, sinking human nature
faltered under the load His Godhead sustained;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
but the thought of &ldquo;pleasing God&rdquo;
nerved and revived Him. &ldquo;Not my will,
but <i>Thine</i> be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is only when the love of God is shed
abroad in the heart, that this animating desire
to &ldquo;please Him&rdquo; can exist. In the holy
bosom of Jesus, that love reigned paramount,
admitting no rival&mdash;no competing affection.
Though infinitely inferior in degree, it is the
same impelling principle which leads His
people still to link enjoyment with His service,
and which makes consecration to Him
of heart and life its own best recompense and
reward. &ldquo;There is a gravitation,&rdquo; says one
whose life was the holy echo of his words,
&ldquo;in the moral as in the physical world.
When love to God is habitually in the ascendant,
or occupying the place of will, it gathers
round it all the other desires of the soul as
satellites, and whirls them along with it in its
orbit round the center of attraction.&rdquo; (<i>Hewitson&#8217;s
Life.</i>) Till the heart, then, be changed,
the believer can not have &ldquo;this testimony
that he <i>pleases God</i>.&rdquo; The world, self, sin&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
be the gods of the unregenerate soul.
And even <i>when</i> changed, alas that there
should be so many ebbings and flowings in
our tide of devotedness! Jesus could say,
&ldquo;I do <i>always</i> those things that please the
Father.&rdquo; Glory to God burned within His
bosom like a living fire. &ldquo;Many waters
could not quench it.&rdquo; His were no fitful and
inconsistent frames and feelings, but the persistent
habit of a holy life, which had the one
end in view, from which it never diverged or
deviated.</p>

<p>Let it be so, in some lowly measure with
us. Let God&#8217;s service not be the mere livery
of high days,&mdash;of set times and seasons; but,
like the alabaster box of ointment, let us ever
be giving forth the fragrant perfume of holiness.
Even when the shadows of trial are
falling around us, let us &ldquo;pass through the
cloud&rdquo; with the sustaining motive&mdash;&ldquo;All my
wish, O God, is to please and glorify Thee!
By giving or taking&mdash;by smiting or healing&mdash;by
the sweet cup or the bitter&mdash;&lsquo;Father,
glorify thy name!&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&#8217;t want to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
weary of God&#8217;s dealing with me,&rdquo; said Bickersteth,
on his death-bed; &ldquo;I want to glorify
Jesus in them, and to find Him more precious.&rdquo;
Do I shrink from trials&mdash;duties&mdash;crosses&mdash;because
involving hardships and self-denial,
or because frowned on by the world? Let
the thought of God&#8217;s approving countenance
be enough. Let me dread no censure, if conscious
of acting in accordance with <i>His</i> will.
Let the Apostle&#8217;s monitory word determine
many a perplexing path&mdash;&ldquo;If I please men,
I am not the servant of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>GRIEF AT SIN.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Being grieved for the hardness of their hearts.&rdquo;&mdash;Mark,
iii. 5.</p>

<p>On this one occasion only is the expression
used with reference to Jesus&mdash;(what intensity
of emotion does it denote, spoken of a
sinless nature!)&mdash;&ldquo;He looked round on them
<i>with anger</i>!&rdquo; Never did He grieve for Himself.
His intensest sorrows were reserved for
those who were tampering with their own
souls, and dishonoring His God. The continual
spectacle of moral evil, thrust on the gaze
of spotless purity, made His earthly history
one consecutive history of grief, one perpetual
&ldquo;cross and passion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the tears shed at the grave of Bethany,
sympathy, doubtless, for the world&#8217;s myriad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
mourners, had its own share (the bereaved
could not part with so precious a tribute in
their hours of sadness), but a far more impressive
cause was one undiscerned by the weeping
sisters and sorrowing crowd; His knowledge
of the deep and obdurate impenitence of those
who were about to gaze on the mightiest of
miracles, only to &ldquo;despise, and wonder, and
perish.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Jesus wept!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;but His profoundest
anguish was over resisted grace, abused privileges,
scorned mercy. It was the Divine
Artificer mourning over His shattered handiwork;
the Almighty Creator weeping over
His ruined world; God, the God-man, &ldquo;grieving&rdquo;
over the Temple of the soul, a humiliating
wreck of what once was made &ldquo;after His
own image!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can we sympathize in any respect with such
exalted tears? Do we mourn for sin, our <i>own</i>
sin&mdash;the deep insult which it inflicts on God&mdash;the
ruinous consequences it entails on ourselves?
Do we grieve at sin in <i>others</i>? Do
we know any thing of &ldquo;vexing our souls,&rdquo;
like righteous Lot, &ldquo;from day to day,&rdquo; with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the world&#8217;s &ldquo;unlawful deeds,&rdquo; the stupid
hardness and obduracy of the depraved heart,
which resists alike the appliances of wrath and
love, judgment and mercy? Ah! it is easy,
in general terms, to condemn vice, and to
utter harsh, severe, and cutting denunciations
on the guilty: it is easy to pass uncharitable
comments on the inconsistencies or follies of
others: but to &ldquo;<i>grieve</i>&rdquo; as our Lord did, is a
different thing; to mourn over the hardness
of heart, and yet to have the burning desire
to teach it better things; to hate, as He did,
the sin, but, like Him also, to love the <i>sinner</i>!</p>

<p>Reader! look specially to your own spirit.
In one respect, the example of Jesus falls
short of your case. He had no sin of His
own to mourn over. He could only commiserate
others. <i>Your</i> intensest grief must begin
with <i>yourself</i>. Like the watchful Levite of
old, be a guardian at the temple-gates of your
own soul. Whatever be your besetting iniquity,
your constitutional bias to sin, seek
to guard it with wakeful vigilance. Grieve at
the thought of incurring one passing shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of displeasure from so kind and compassionate
a Saviour. Let this be a holy preservative
in your every hour of temptation, &ldquo;How
can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grieve for a perishing world&mdash;a groaning
creation fettered and chained in unwilling
&ldquo;subjection to vanity.&rdquo; Do what you can,
by effort, by prayer, to hasten on the hour of
jubilee, when its ashy robes of sin and sorrow
shall be laid aside, and, attired in the
&ldquo;beauties of holiness,&rdquo; it shall exult in &ldquo;the
glorious liberty of the sons of God!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>HUMILITY.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;He riseth from supper, and laid aside His garments;
and took a towel and girded Himself. After that He
poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the
disciples&#8217; feet.&rdquo;&mdash;John, xiii. 4, 5.</p>

<p>What a matchless picture of humility!
At the very moment when His throne was in
view; angel-anthems floating in His ear;
the hour come &ldquo;when He was to depart out
of this world;&rdquo; possessing a lofty consciousness
of His peerless dignity, that &ldquo;He came
<i>from</i> God and went <i>to</i> God;&rdquo; <span class="smcap">then</span> &ldquo;Jesus
took a towel, and girded Himself, and began
to wash the disciples&#8217; feet!&rdquo; All heaven was
ready at that moment to cast their combined
crowns at His feet. But the High and the
Lofty One, inhabiting eternity, is on earth &ldquo;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
one that serveth!&rdquo; &ldquo;That <i>infinite stoop</i>! it
sinks all creature humiliation to nothing, and
renders it impossible for a creature to <i>humble</i>
himself.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Evans</i>).</p>

<p>Humility follows Him, from His unhonored
birthplace to His borrowed grave. It throws
a subdued splendor over all He did. &ldquo;The
poor in spirit,&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;mourner,&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;meek,&rdquo;&mdash;claim
His first beatitudes. He was severe
only to one class&mdash;those who looked down
upon others. However He is employed;
whether performing His works of miraculous
power, or receiving angel-visitants, or taking
little children in His arms, He stands forth
&ldquo;clothed with humility.&rdquo; Nay, this humility
becomes more conspicuous as He draws nearer
glory. Before His death, He calls His disciples
&ldquo;<i>Friends</i>;&rdquo; subsequently, it is &ldquo;<i>Brethren</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Children</i>.&rdquo; How sad the contrast between
the Master and His disciples! Two
hours had not elapsed after He washed their
feet, when &ldquo;there was a strife among them
which should be the greatest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let the mental image of that lowly Redeemer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
be ever bending over us. His example
may well speak in silent impressiveness,
bringing us down from our pedestal of pride.
There surely can be no labor of love too
humiliating when <i>He</i> stooped so low. Let us
be content to take the humblest place; not
envious of the success or exaltation of another;
not, &ldquo;like Diotrephes, loving pre&euml;minence;&rdquo;
&ldquo;but willing to be thought little
of;&rdquo; saying with the Baptist, with our eye on
our Lord, &ldquo;He must increase, but I must
decrease!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How much we have cause to be humble
for! the constant cleaving of defilement to
our souls; and even what is partially good in
us, how mixed with imperfection, self-seeking,
arrogance, vain-glory! A proud Christian is
a contradiction in terms. The Seraphim of
old (type of the Christian Church, and of
believers) had six wings&mdash;<i>two</i> were for errands
of love, but &ldquo;with <i>four</i> he <i>covered</i> himself!&rdquo;
It has been beautifully said, &ldquo;You lie nearest
the River of Life when you <i>bend</i> to it; you
can not drink, but as you <i>stoop</i>.&rdquo; The corn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of the field, as it ripens, bows its head; so the
Christian, as he ripens in the Divine life, bends
in this lowly grace. Christ speaks of His
people as &ldquo;lilies&rdquo;&mdash;they are &ldquo;lilies of <i>the
valley</i>,&rdquo; they can only grow in the shade!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humble yourselves under the mighty
hand of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go&rdquo; with what Rutherford
calls &ldquo;a low sail.&rdquo; It is the livery of your
blessed Master; the family badge&mdash;the family
likeness. &ldquo;With this man will I dwell, even
with him that is <i>humble</i>.&rdquo; Yes! the humble,
sanctified heart is God&#8217;s <i>second Heaven</i>!</p>

<h4>PATIENCE.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter.&rdquo;&mdash;Isa.
liii, 7.</p>

<p>How great was the <i>patience</i> of Jesus! Even
among His own disciples, how forbearingly
He endured their blindness, their misconceptions
and hardness of heart! Philip had been
for three years with Him, yet he had &ldquo;not
known Him!&rdquo;&mdash;all that time he had remained
in strange and culpable ignorance of his Lord&#8217;s
dignity and glory. See how tenderly Jesus
bears with him; giving him nothing in reply
for his confession of ignorance but unparalleled
promises of grace! Peter, the honored and
trusted, becomes a renegade and a coward.
Justly might his dishonored Lord, stung with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
such unrequited love, have cut the unworthy
cumberer down. But He spares him, bears
with him, gently rebukes him, and loves him
more than ever! See the Divine Sufferer in
the terminating scenes of His own ignominy
and woe. How patient!&mdash;&ldquo;As a sheep before
her shearers is dumb, so He opened not His
mouth.&rdquo; In these awful moments, outraged
Omnipotence might have summoned twelve
legions of angels and put into the hand of each
a vial of wrath. But He submits in meek,
majestic silence. Verily, in <i>Him</i> &ldquo;patience
had her <i>perfect</i> work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Think of this same patience with His Church
and people since He ascended to glory. The
years upon years He has borne with their
perverse resistance of His grace, their treacherous
ingratitude, their wayward wanderings,
their hardness of heart and contempt of His
holy word. Yet, behold the forbearing love
of this Saviour of God! His hand of mercy
is &ldquo;stretched out still!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Child of God! art thou now undergoing
some bitter trial? The way of thy God, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
may be, all mystery; no footprints of love
traceable in the checkered path; no light, in
the clouds above; no ray in the dark future.
<i>Be patient!</i> &ldquo;The Lord is good to them that
<i>wait</i> for Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;They that <i>wait</i> on the Lord
shall renew their strength!&rdquo; Or hast thou
been long tossed on some bed of sickness&mdash;days
of pain and nights of weariness appointed
thee? <i>Be patient!</i> &ldquo;I trust this groaning,&rdquo;
said a suffering saint, &ldquo;is not murmuring.&rdquo;
God, by this very affliction, is nurturing within
thee this beauteous grace which shone so
conspicuously in the character of thy dear
Lord. With Him it was a lovely <i>habit</i> of the
soul. With thee, the &ldquo;tribulation&rdquo; which
worketh &ldquo;patience&rdquo; is needful discipline. It
is <i>good</i> for a man that he should both hope
and quietly <i>wait</i> for the salvation of God.
Art thou suffering some unmerited wrong or
unkindness, exposed to harsh and wounding
accusations, hard for flesh and blood to bear?
<i>Be patient!</i> Beware of hastiness of speech or
temper; remember how much evil may be
done by a few inconsiderate words &rdquo;spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
unadvisedly with the lip.&rdquo; Think of Jesus
standing before a human tribunal, in the
silent submissiveness of conscious innocence
and integrity. Leave thy cause with God.
Let this be the only form of thy complaint,
&ldquo;O God, I am oppressed; undertake Thou for
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In patience,&rdquo; then, &ldquo;possess ye your
souls.&rdquo; Let it not be a grace for peculiar
seasons, called forth on peculiar exigences;
but an habitual frame manifested in the calm
serenity of a daily walk;&mdash;placidity amid the
little fretting annoyances of every-day life&mdash;a
fixed purpose of the heart to wait upon God,
and cast its every burden upon Him.</p>

<h4>SUBJECTION.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;As the Father gave me commandment, even so I
do.&rdquo;&mdash;John, xiv. 31.</p>

<p>Jesus as God-man had omnipotence slumbering
in His arm. He had the hoarded
treasures of eternity in His grasp. He had
only to &ldquo;speak, and it was done.&rdquo; But, as an
example to His people, His whole life on
earth was one impressive act of subordination
and dependence. At Nazareth He was
&ldquo;subject to His parents.&rdquo; There He remained
in studied obscurity, occupying for
thirty years a lowly hut, willing to continue
in a state of seclusion, till the Father&#8217;s summons
called Him to His appointed work.</p>

<p>At His baptism, sinless Himself, He gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
this reason for receiving a sinner&#8217;s rite at a
sinner&#8217;s hands&mdash;&ldquo;Suffer it to be so now, for
thus it becometh Me to fulfill all righteousness.&rdquo;
The same beautiful spirit of filial
<i>subjection</i> shines conspicuous amid His acts of
stupendous power. &ldquo;Jesus lifted up His eyes
and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard Me; and I know that Thou hearest
Me always; but because of the people which
stand by, I said it, that they may believe that
Thou has sent Me.&rdquo; Even among His own
disciples His language is, &ldquo;I am among you
as He that serveth.&rdquo; With an act of submission
He closed His pilgrimage and work of
love. &ldquo;Father, into Thy hands I commend
My spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What an example to us, in all this, is our
beloved Lord! Surely, if <i>He</i>, &ldquo;God only
wise&rdquo;&mdash;the Self-existent One, to whom &ldquo;all
power was committed;&rdquo;&mdash;the Sinless One,
never liable to err, on whom &ldquo;the Spirit was
poured without measure&rdquo;&mdash;if <i>He</i> manifested
such habitual dependence on His heavenly
Father, how earnestly ought <i>we</i>, weak, erring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
fallible creatures, to seek to live every hour&mdash;every
moment&mdash;as pensioners on God&#8217;s grace
and love, following in all things His directing
hand! As the servant has his eyes on his
master, or the child on its parent, &ldquo;so should
our eyes be on the Lord our God.&rdquo; Howsoever
He speaks, be it ours with all docility to
follow the voice, indorsing every utterance
of providence, and every precept of Scripture,
with our Lord&#8217;s own words, &ldquo;<i>This is the
Father&#8217;s will!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beware of self-dependence. The first step
in spiritual declension is this: &ldquo;Let him that
<i>thinketh he standeth</i>!&rdquo; The secret of real
strength is this: &ldquo;<i>Kept</i> by the <i>power of
God</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How it sweetens all our blessings, and alleviates
all our sorrows, to regard both as emanations
from a loving Father&#8217;s hand. Even
if we should be, like the disciples of old,
&ldquo;<i>constrained</i>&rdquo; to go into the ship; if all
should be darkness and tempest, frowning
providences&mdash;&ldquo;the wind contrary;&rdquo; how
blessed to feel that in embarking on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
unquiet element, &ldquo;the Lord has bidden us!&rdquo;
Paul could not speak even of taking an
earthly journey, without the parenthesis (&ldquo;if
the Lord will&rdquo;). How many trials, and sorrows,
and <i>sins</i>, would it save us, if the same
were the habitual regulator of our daily life!
It would lead to calm contentment with our lot,
hushing every disquieting suggestion with the
thought that that lot, with all that is apparently
adverse in it, was <i>ordained</i> for us. It would
teach us not to be aspiring after <i>great</i> things,
but humbly to wait the will and purposes of
a wise Provider; not to go <i>before</i> our Heavenly
Guide, but to <i>follow</i> Him, saying, in meek
subjection, &ldquo;Lord, my heart is not haughty,
nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exercise myself
in great matters, or in things too high for
for me ... my soul is even as a weaned
child!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>NOT RETALIATING.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again.&rdquo;&mdash;1 Peter, ii. 23.</p>

<p>What a common dictate of the fallen and
regenerate heart to resent and recriminate!
How alien to natural feeling to answer cutting
taunts, and meet unmerited wrong with the
Divine method the Gospel prescribes&mdash;&ldquo;Overcome
evil with good!&rdquo; It was in the closing
scenes of the Saviour&#8217;s humiliation, when,
silent and unresenting, He stood &ldquo;dumb
before His shearers,&rdquo; that this beautiful feature
in His character was most wondrously
manifested; but it beams forth, also, for our
imitation in the ordinary and less prominent
incidents of His pilgrimage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>When He met Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,
He found him clinging to an unreasonable
prejudice&mdash;&ldquo;Can any good thing come out of
Nazareth?&rdquo; The severe remark is allowed
to pass unnoticed. Overlooking the unkind
insinuation, the Saviour fixes on the favorable
feature of his character, &ldquo;Behold an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no guile!&rdquo; After His
resurrection, He appears to His disciples.
They were cowering in shame, half afraid to
confront the glance of injured goodness. He
breathes on them, and says, &ldquo;Peace be unto
you!&rdquo; Peter was the one of all the rest who
had most reason to dread estranged looks and
upbraiding words; but a special message is
sent to reassure that trembling spirit that there
was no alienation in the unresentful Heart he
had so deeply wounded; &ldquo;Go and tell the
disciples ... and <i>Peter</i>!&rdquo; Even when
Judas first revealed himself to his Lord as the
betrayer, we believe it was not in bitter irony
or rebuke, but in the fullness of pitying tenderness,
that Jesus addressed him, &ldquo;Friend,
wherefore art thou come?&rdquo; Tears and prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
were His only revenge on the city and scene
of His murder. &ldquo;Beginning at Jerusalem,&rdquo;
was the closing illustration of a spirit &ldquo;not
of this world&rdquo;&mdash;a significant parting testimony
that in the bosom that uttered it retaliation
had no place.</p>

<p>More than one of the disciples seem to have
imbibed much of this &ldquo;mind&rdquo; of their Lord.
&ldquo;We owe St. Paul,&rdquo; says Augustine, &ldquo;to the
death of Stephen;&rdquo; &ldquo;they stoned Stephen ... and
he kneeled down and cried
with a loud voice, Lord! lay not this sin to
their charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Take another example: The great Apostle
of the Gentiles felt himself under a painful
necessity faithfully to rebuke Peter in presence
of the whole Church. He had <i>recorded</i> that
rebuke, too, in one of his epistles. It was thus
to be handed down to every age as a permanent
and humiliating evidence of the wavering
inconstancy of his fellow-laborer. Peter,
doubtless, must have felt acutely the severity
of the chastisement. Does he resent it? He,
too, puts on record, long after, in one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
own epistles a sentence regarding his Rebuker,
but it is this&mdash;&ldquo;Our <i>beloved brother</i>
Paul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! when tempted to utter the harsh
word, or give the cutting or hasty answer,
seek to check yourself with the question, &ldquo;Is
this the reply my Saviour would have given?&rdquo;
If your fellow-men should prove unkind, inconsiderate,
ungrateful, be it yours to refer the
cause to God. Speak of the faults of others
only in prayer; manifesting more sorrow for
the sin of the censorious and unkind, than for
the evil inflicted on yourselves. <i>Retaliate!</i>
No such word should have a place in the
Christian&#8217;s vocabulary. <i>Retaliate!</i> If I cherish
such a spirit towards my brother, how can
I meet that brother in heaven?&mdash;&ldquo;But ye
have not so learned in Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>BEARING THE CROSS.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;And He bearing His cross.&rdquo;&mdash;John, xix. 17.</p>

<p>When did Jesus bear the cross? Not that
moment alone, surely, when the bitter tree
was placed on His shoulders, on the way to
Golgotha. Its vision may be said to have
risen before Him in His infant dreams in
Bethlehem&#8217;s cradle; there, rather, its reality
began; and He ceased not to carry it, till His
work was finished, and the victory won! A
<i>cloud</i>, of old, hovered over the mercy-seat in
the tabernacle and temple. So it was with
the Great Antitype&mdash;the living Mercy-Seat&mdash;He
had ever a cloud of woe hanging over
him. &ldquo;He <i>carried</i> our sorrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! dwell much and often under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
shadow of your Lord&#8217;s cross, and it will lead
you to think lightly of your own! If <i>He</i>
gave utterance to not one murmuring word,
canst <i>thou</i> complain? &ldquo;If we were deeper
students of his bitter anguish, we should think
less of the ripplings of our waves, amidst His
horrible tempest.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Evans.</i>) The saint&#8217;s cross
assumes many and diverse shapes. Sometimes
it is the bitter trial, the crushing pang of
bereavement&mdash;desolate households, and aching
hearts. Sometimes it is the crucifixion
of sin, the determined battle with &ldquo;lusts
which war against the soul.&rdquo; Sometimes it is
the resistance of evil maxims and practices of
a lying world; vindicating the honor of
Christ, in the midst, it may be, of taunt, and
obloquy, and shame. And as there are different
crosses, so there are different ways of
bearing them. To some, God says, &ldquo;put your
shoulder to the burden; lift it up, and bear it
on; work, and toil, and labor!&rdquo; To others,
He says, &ldquo;Be still, bear it, and <i>suffer</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Believer! thy cross may be hard to endure;
it may involve deep struggles&mdash;tears by day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
watchings by night; bear it meekly, patiently,
justifying God&#8217;s wisdom in laying it on. Rejoice
in the assurance that He gives not one
atom more of earthly trial than He sees to be
really needful; not one redundant thorn
pierces your feet. In the very bearing of the
cross for <i>His</i> sake, there are mighty compensations.
What new views of your Saviour&#8217;s
love! His truth, His promises, His sustaining
grace, His sufferings, His glory! What new
filial nearness; increased delight in prayer;
an inner sunshine when it is darkest without!
The waves cover you, but underneath them
all, are &ldquo;the everlasting arms!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do not look out for a situation <i>without</i>
crosses. Be not over anxious about &ldquo;smooth
paths;&rdquo;&mdash;leaving your God, as Orpah did
Naomi, just when the cross requires to be
carried. Immoderate earthly enjoyments&mdash;unbroken
earthly prosperity&mdash;write upon
these, &ldquo;<i>Beware!</i>&rdquo; You may live to see them
become your greatest trials!</p>

<p>Remember the old saying, &ldquo;No cross, no
crown.&rdquo; The sun of the saint&#8217;s life generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
struggles through &ldquo;weeping clouds.&rdquo; One of
the loveliest passages of Scripture is that in
which, the portals of heaven being opened, we
overhear this dialogue between two ransomed
ones&mdash;&ldquo;And one of the elders answered saying
unto me, What are these which are arrayed
in white robes, and whence came they?
And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And
he said to me, <i>These are they which came out of
great tribulation!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h4>HOLY ZEAL.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;The zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up.&rdquo;&mdash;John,
ii. 17.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zeal, is a principle; enthusiasm is a feeling.
The one is a spark of a sanguine temperament
and overheated imagination. The other, a
sacred flame kindled at God&#8217;s altar, and burning
in God&#8217;s shrine.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Vaughan.</i>) Such was the
holy, heavenly zeal of our Great Exemplar!
His were no transient outbursts of ardor,
which time cooled and difficulties impeded.
His life was one indignant protest against sin;&mdash;one
ceaseless current of undying love for
souls, which all the malignity of foes, and unkindness
of friends, could not for one moment
divert from its course. Even when He rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
from the dead, and we imagine His work at an
end, His zeal only meditates fresh deeds of
love. &ldquo;Still His heart and His care,&rdquo; says
Godwin, &ldquo;is upon doing more. Having now
dispatched that great work on earth, He sends
His disciples word that He is hastening to
heaven as fast as He can, to do another.&rdquo;
(John, xx. 17).</p>

<p>Reader! do you know any thing of this
zeal, which &ldquo;many waters could not quench&rdquo;?
See that, like your Lord&#8217;s, it be steady, sober,
consistent, undeviating. How many are, like
the children of Ephraim, &ldquo;carrying bows&rdquo;&mdash;all
zealous when zeal demands no sacrifice,
but &ldquo;turning their backs in the day of battle!&rdquo;
Others &ldquo;running well&rdquo; for a time, but gradually
&ldquo;hindered,&rdquo; through the benumbing
influences of worldliness, selfishness, and sin.
Two disciples, apparently equally devoted and
zealous, send through Paul, in one of his
epistles, a conjoint Christian salutation&mdash;&ldquo;Luke
and Demas greet you.&rdquo; A few years
afterward, thus he writes from his Roman

hath <i>forsaken</i> me, having loved this present
world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While zeal is commendable, remember the
Apostle&#8217;s qualification, &ldquo;It is good to be
zealously affected always in a <i>good</i> thing.&rdquo;
There is in these days much base coin current,
<i>called</i> &ldquo;zeal,&rdquo; which bears not the image and
superscription of Jesus. There is zeal for
church-membership and party; zeal for creeds
and dogmas; zeal for figments and non-essentials.
&ldquo;From such turn aside.&rdquo; Your Lord
stamped with His example and approval no
such counterfeits. <i>His</i> zeal was ever brought
to bear on two objects, and two objects alone&mdash;<i>the
glory of God</i> and <i>the good of man</i>. Be it
so with <i>you</i>. Enter, first of all (as He did the
earthly temple), the sanctuary of <i>your own
heart</i>, with &ldquo;the scourge of small cords.&rdquo;
Drive out every unhallowed intruder there.
Do not suffer yourself to be deceived. Others
may call such jealous searchings of spirit
&ldquo;sanctimoniousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;enthusiasm.&rdquo; But
remember, to be <i>almost saved</i>, is to be <i>altogether
lost</i>!&mdash;to be zealous about every thing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
&ldquo;the one thing needful,&rdquo; is an insult to God
and your everlasting interests!</p>

<p>Have a zeal for <i>others</i>. Dying myriads are
around you. As a member of the Christian
priesthood, it becomes you to rush in with
your censer and incense between the living
and the dead, &ldquo;that the plague may be
stayed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Be it yours to say, &ldquo;Blessed Jesus! I am
<i>Thine</i>!&mdash;Thine only!&mdash;Thine wholly!&mdash;Thine
for ever! I am willing to follow Thee, and
(if need be) to <i>suffer</i> for Thee. I am ready at
Thy bidding to leave the homestead in the
valley, and to face the cutting blasts of the
mountain. Take me&mdash;use me for Thy glory.
&lsquo;Lord! what wilt Thou have me to do?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h4>BENEVOLENCE.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Who went about doing good.&rdquo;&mdash;Acts, x. 38.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christ&#8217;s great end,&rdquo; says Richard Baxter,
&ldquo;was to save men from their <i>sins</i>; but He
delighted to save them from their <i>sorrows</i>.&rdquo;
His heart bled for human misery. Benevolence
brought Him from heaven; benevolence
followed His steps wherever He went on earth.
The journeys of the Divine Philanthropist
were marked by tears of thankfulness, and
breathings of grateful love. The helpless, the
blind, the lame, the desolate, rejoiced at the
sound of His footfall. Truly might it be said
of Him, &ldquo;When the ear heard me, then it
blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it
gave witness to me.&rdquo; (Job, xxix. 11.) All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
suffering hearts were a magnet to Jesus. It
was not more His prerogative than His happiness
to turn tears into smiles. One of the few
pleasures which on earth gladdened the spirit
of the &ldquo;Man of sorrows&rdquo; was the pleasure of
<i>doing good</i>&mdash;soothing grief, and alleviating
misery. Next to the joy of the widow of
Nain when her son was restored, was the joy
in the bosom of the Divine Restorer! He
often went out of His way to be kind. A
journey was not grudged, even if <i>one</i> aching
spirit were to be soothed. (Mark, v. 1; John,
iv. 4, 5.) Nor were his kindnesses dispensed
through the intervention of others. They
were all personal acts. His own hand healed.
His own voice spake. His own footsteps
lingered on the threshold of bereavement, or
at the precincts of the tomb. Ah! had the
princes of this world known the loving-tenderness
and unselfishness of <i>that</i> heart, &ldquo;they
would not have crucified the Lord of Glory&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Reader! do you know any thing of such
active benevolence? Have you never felt the
<i>luxury</i> of doing good? Have you never felt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
that in making <i>others</i> happy, you make <i>your
self</i> so? that, by a great law of your being,
enunciated by the Divine Patron and Pattern
of Benevolence, &ldquo;it is more blessed to give
than to receive&rdquo;? Has God enriched you
with this world&#8217;s goods? Seek to view yourself
as a consecrated medium for dispensing
them to others. Beware alike of penurious
hoarding and selfish extravagance. How sad
the case of those whose lot God has made thus
to abound with temporal mercies, who have
gone to the grave unconscious of diminishing
one drop of human misery, or making one of
the world&#8217;s myriad aching hearts happier!
How the example of <i>Jesus</i> rebukes the cold
and calculating kindnesses&mdash;the mite-like
offerings of many even of His own people!
&ldquo;whose libation is not like His, from the brim
of an overflowing cup, but from the bottom&mdash;from
the <i>dregs</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may have little to give. Your sphere
and means may be alike limited. But remember
God can be as much glorified by the trifle
saved from the earnings of poverty, as by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
splendid benefaction from the lap of plenty
&ldquo;The Lord loveth a <i>cheerful</i> giver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nobler part of Christian benevolence
is not vast largesses, munificent pecuniary
sacrifices. &ldquo;<i>He went about</i> doing good.&rdquo; The
merciful visit&mdash;the friendly word&mdash;the look
of sympathy&mdash;the cup of cold water, the
little unostentatious service&mdash;the giving without
thought or hope of recompense&mdash;the
kindly &ldquo;considering of the poor&rdquo;&mdash;anticipating
their wants&mdash;studying their comforts;
these are what God values and loves. They
are &ldquo;loans&rdquo; to Himself&mdash;tributary streams to
&ldquo;the river of <i>His</i> pleasure;&rdquo; they will be
acknowledged at last as such&mdash;&ldquo;Ye did it
unto <i>Me</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>FIRMNESS IN TEMPTATION.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Jesus saith unto him, Get thee hence, Satan.&rdquo;&mdash;Matt.
iv. 10.</p>

<p>There is an awful intensity of meaning in
the words, as applied to Jesus, &ldquo;He <i>suffered</i>,
being tempted!&rdquo; Though incapable of sin,
there was, in the refined sensibilities of His
holy nature, that which made temptation unspeakably
fearful. What must it have been
to confront the Arch-traitor?&mdash;to stand face
to face with the foe of His throne, and His
universe? But the &ldquo;prince of this world&rdquo;
came, and found &ldquo;nothing in Him.&rdquo; Billow
after billow of Satanic violence spent their
fury, in vain, on the Living Rock!</p>

<p>Reader! you have still the same malignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
enemy to contend with; assailing you in a
thousand insidious forms; marvelously adapting
his assaults to your circumstances, your
temperament, your mental bias, your master-passion!
There is no place where &ldquo;Satan&#8217;s seat&rdquo;
is not; &ldquo;the whole world lieth in the Wicked
one.&rdquo; (1 John, v. 19.) He has his whispers
for the ear of childhood; hoary age is not
inaccessible to his wiles. &ldquo;<i>All this will I give
thee</i>&rdquo;&mdash;is still his bribe to deny Jesus and to
&ldquo;mind earthly things.&rdquo; He will meet you
in the crowd; he will follow you to the solitude;
his is a sleepless vigilance!</p>

<p>Are you bold in repelling him as your
Master was? Are you ready with the retort
to every foul suggestion, &ldquo;Get thee hence,
Satan&rdquo;? Cultivate a tender sensitiveness
about sin. The finest barometers are the
most sensitive. Whatever be your besetting
frailty&mdash;whatever bitter or baleful passion
you are conscious aspires to the mastery&mdash;watch
it, crucify it, &ldquo;nail it to your Lord&#8217;s
cross.&rdquo; <i>You</i> may despise &ldquo;the day of small
things&rdquo;&mdash;the Great Adversary does <i>not</i>. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
knows the power of <i>littles</i>; that little by
little consumes and eats out the vigor of the
soul. And once the retrograde movement in
the spiritual life begins, who can predict where
it may end? the going on &ldquo;from weakness to
weakness,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;from strength to
strength.&rdquo; Make no compromises; never
join in the ungodly amusement, or venture on
the questionable path, with the plea, &ldquo;It does
me no harm.&rdquo; The Israelites, on entering
Canaan, instead of obeying the Divine injunction
of extirpating their enemies, made a
hollow truce with them. What was the result?
Years upon years of tedious warfare.
&ldquo;They were scourges in their sides, and
thorns in their eyes!&rdquo; It is quaintly but
truthfully said by an old writer, &ldquo;The candle
will never burn clear, while there is a <i>thief</i> in
it. Sin indulged, in the conscience, is like
Jonah in the ship, which causeth such a
tempest, that the conscience is like a troubled
sea, whose waters cannot rest.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Thomas
Brooks</i>.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep,&rdquo; then, &ldquo;thy heart with all diligence,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
or, (as it is in the forcible original
Hebrew,) &ldquo;keep thy heart <i>above all keeping</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;for out of it are the issues of life.&rdquo; (Prov.
iv. 23.) Let this ever be your preservative
against temptation, &ldquo;How would <i>Jesus</i> have
acted here? would <i>He</i> not have recoiled, like
the sensitive plant, from the remotest contact
with sin? Can <i>I</i> think of dishonoring Him
by tampering with His enemy; incurring
from His own lips the bitter reflection of injured
love, &lsquo;I am wounded in the house of
my friends&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tells us the secret of our preservation
and safety, &ldquo;Simon! Simon! Satan hath
desired to have thee, that he might sift thee
as wheat; <i>but I</i> have prayed for thee that thy
faith fail not!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>RECEIVING SINNERS.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;This man receiveth sinners.&rdquo;&mdash;Luke, xv. 2.</p>

<p>The ironical taunt of proud and censorious
Pharisees formed the glory of Him who came,
&ldquo;not to call the righteous, but sinners, to
repentance.&rdquo; Publicans and outcasts; those
covered with a deeper than any bodily leprosy&mdash;laid
bare their wounds to the &ldquo;Great
Physician;&rdquo; and as conscious guilt and timid
penitence crept abashed and imploring to His
feet, they found nothing but a forgiving and
a gracious welcome!</p>

<p>&ldquo;His ways&rdquo; were not as &ldquo;man&#8217;s ways!&rdquo;
The &ldquo;watchmen,&rdquo; in the Canticles, &ldquo;smote&rdquo;
the disconsolate one seeking her lost Lord;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
they tore off her veil, mocking with chilling
unkindness her anguished tears. Not so
&ldquo;the Chief Shepherd and Bishop of souls.&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>This</i> man <i>receiveth</i> sinners&rdquo;! See Nicodemus,
stealing under the shadows of night
to elude observation&mdash;type of the thousand
thousand who in every age have gone trembling
in their night of sin and sorrow to this
Heavenly Friend! Does Jesus punish his
timidity by shutting His door against him,
spurning him from His presence? &ldquo;He will
not break the bruised reed, He will not quench
the smoking flax!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And He is still the same! He who arrested
a persecutor in his blasphemies, and tuned the
lips of an expiring felon with faith and love,
is at this hour standing, with all the garnered
treasures of Redemption in His hand, proclaiming,
&ldquo;Him that cometh unto Me, I will
in no wise cast out&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Are we from this to think lightly of sin?
or, by example and conduct, to palliate and
overlook its enormity? Not so; sin, <i>as</i> sin,
can never be sufficiently stamped with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
brand of reprobation. But we must seek
carefully to distinguish between the offence
and the offender. Nothing should be done on
our part, by word or deed, to mock the penitential
sighings of a guilty spirit, or send the
trembling outcast away, with the despairing
feeling of &ldquo;<i>No hope</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;This man receiveth
sinners,&rdquo; and shall not <i>we</i>? Does <i>He</i> suffer
the veriest dregs of human depravity to
crouch unbidden at His feet, and to gaze on
His forgiving countenance with the uplifted
eye of hope, and shall <i>we</i> dare to deal out
harsh, and severe, and crushing verdicts on an
offending (it may be a <i>deeply</i> offending) brother?
Shall we pronounce &ldquo;crimson&rdquo; and
&ldquo;scarlet&rdquo; sins and sinners beyond the pale of
mercy, when <i>Jesus</i> does not? Nay, rather,
when wretchedness, and depravity, and backsliding
cross our path, let it not be with the
bitter taunt or the ironical retort that we bid
them away. Let us bear, endure, remonstrate,
deal tenderly. Jesus <i>did</i> so, Jesus <i>does</i> so!
Ah! If we had within us His unconquerable
love of souls; His yearning desire for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
everlasting happiness of sinners, we should be
more frequently in earnest expostulation and
affectionate appeal with those who have hitherto
got no other than harsh thoughts and repulsive
words. If this &ldquo;mind&rdquo; really were in
us, &ldquo;which was also in Him,&rdquo; we should more
frequently ask ourselves, &ldquo;Have I done all I
<i>might</i> have done to pluck this brand from the
burning! Have I remembered what grace
<i>has</i> wrought, what grace <i>can</i> do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brethren, if any of you do err from the
truth, and one convert him, let him know,
that he which converteth the sinner from the
error of his way shall save a soul from death,
and shall hide a multitude of sins!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>GUILELESSNESS.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Neither was guile found in His mouth.&rdquo;&mdash;1 Pet. ii. 22.</p>

<p>How rare, and all the more beautiful because
of its rarity, is a purely <i>guileless</i> spirit!
A crystalline medium through which the
transparent light of Heaven comes and goes;
open, candid, just, honorable, sincere; scorning
every unfair dealing, every hollow pretension,
every narrow prejudice. Wherever such
characters exist, they are like &ldquo;apples of gold
in pictures of silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such, in all the loveliness of sinless perfection,
was the Son of God! His guilelessness
shining the more conspicuously amid the artful
and malignant subtlety alike of men and
devils. Passing by manifold instances in the
course of His ministry, look at its manifestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
as the hour of His death approached.
When, on the night of his apprehension, He
confronts the assassin band, in meek majesty
He puts the question, &ldquo;Whom seek ye?&rdquo;
They say to Him, &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo; In
guileless innocence, He replies, &ldquo;I am He!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Art thou the King of the Jews?&rdquo; asks
Pilate, a few hours after. An evasive answer
might again have purchased immunity from
suffering and indignity, but once more the lips
which scorned the semblance of evasion reply,
&ldquo;Thou sayest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How He loved the same spirit in His
people! &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said He, of Nathanael,
&ldquo;an Israelite indeed, in whom is <i>no guile</i>!&rdquo;
That upright man had, we may suppose, been
day after day kneeling in prayer under his
fig-tree, with an open and candid spirit&mdash;</p>

<p class="small" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right:10%;">
&ldquo;Musing on the law he taught,<br />
And waiting for the Lord he loved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>See how the Saviour honored him; setting
His own Divine seal on the loveliness of this
same spirit! Take one other example, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the startling, saddening announcement is made
to the disciples, &ldquo;One of you shall betray
me;&rdquo; they do not accuse one another; they
attempt to throw no suspicion on Judas; each
in trembling apprehension suspects only his
own treacherous heart, &ldquo;Lord, is it I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>How much of a different &ldquo;mind&rdquo; is there
abroad! In the school of the world (this &ldquo;<i>painted</i>
world&rdquo;), how much is there of what is called
&ldquo;policy,&rdquo; double-dealing!&mdash;accomplishing its
ends by tortuous means; outward, artificial
polish, often only a cloak for baseness and
selfishness!&mdash;in the daily interchange of business,
one seeking to over-reach the other by
wily arts; sacrificing principle for temporal
advantage. There is nothing so derogatory
to religion as aught allied to such a spirit
among Christ&#8217;s people&mdash;any such blot on the
&ldquo;living epistles.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye are the light of the
world.&rdquo; That world is a quick observer. It
is sharp to detect inconsistencies&mdash;slow to forget
them. The true Christian has been
likened to an <i>anagram</i>&mdash;you ought to be able
to read him up and down, every way!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Be all reality, no counterfeit. Do not pass
for current coin what is base alloy. Let
transparent honor and sincerity regulate all
your dealings; despise all meanness; avoid
the sinister motive, the underhand dealing;
aim at that unswerving love of truth that
would scorn to stoop to base compliances and
unworthy equivocations; live more under the
power of the purifying and ennobling influences
of the gospel. Take its golden rule
as the matchless directory for the daily transactions
of life&mdash;&ldquo;Whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to
them.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>ACTIVITY IN DUTY.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;I must work the works of Him that sent me, while it
is day; the night cometh, when no man can work.&rdquo;&mdash;John,
ix. 4.</p>

<p>How constant and unremitting was Jesus
in the service of His Heavenly Father! &ldquo;He
rose a great while before day;&rdquo; and, when His
secret communion was over, His public work
began. It mattered not to Him where He
was: whether on the bosom of the deep, or a
mountain slope&mdash;in the desert, or at a well-side&mdash;the
&ldquo;gracious words&rdquo; ever &ldquo;proceeded
out of His mouth.&rdquo; We find, on one touching
occasion, exhausted nature sinking, after a
day of unremitting duty; in crossing, in a
vessel, the Lake of Tiberias&mdash;&ldquo;<i>He fell asleep</i>&rdquo;!
(Matt. viii.) He redeemed every precious
moment. His words to the Pharisee seem a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
<i>formula</i> for all, &ldquo;Simon, I have somewhat to
say unto <i>thee</i>&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Oh, how our most unceasing activities pale
into nothing before such an example as this!
Would that we could remember that each of
us has some great mission to perform for God,
that religion is not a thing of dreamy sentimentalism,
but of energetic practical action;
moreover, that no trade, no profession, no
position, however high or however humble in
the scale of society, can disqualify for this life
of Christian activity and usefulness! Who
were the writers in the Bible? We have
among them a King&mdash;a Lawgiver&mdash;a Herdsman&mdash;a
Publican&mdash;a Physician! Nor is it
to high spheres, or to great services only, that
God looks. The widow&#8217;s mite and Mary&#8217;s
&ldquo;alabaster box of ointment&rdquo; are recorded as
examples for imitation by the Holy Ghost,
while many more munificent deeds are passed
by unrecorded. We believe that God says,
regarding the attempt of many a humble
Christian to serve Him by active duty, &ldquo;I
saw that effort, that <i>feeble</i> effort to serve and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
glorify Me; it was the very <i>feebleness</i> of it I
loved!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did it never strike you, notwithstanding
the <i>dignity</i> of Christ, and the <i>activity</i> of Christ,
how little success comparatively He met with
in His public work? We read of no <i>numerous</i>
conversions; no Pentecostal revivals in the
course of His ministry. May not this well
encourage in the absence of great outward
results? He sets up no higher standard than
this&mdash;&ldquo;She hath done what she could.&rdquo; An
artist may be <i>great</i> in painting a peasant as
well as a king&mdash;<i>it is the way he does it</i>. Yes,
and if laid aside from the <i>activities</i> of the
Christian life, we can equally glorify God by
<i>passive endurance</i>. &ldquo;Who am I,&rdquo; said Luther,
when he witnessed the patience of a great
sufferer; &ldquo;who am I? a wordy preacher in
comparison with this great doer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! forget not the motive of our motto
verse, &ldquo;<i>The night cometh!</i>&rdquo; Soon our tale
shall be told; our little day is flitting fast, the
shadows of night are falling. &ldquo;Our span
length of time,&rdquo; as Rutherford says, &ldquo;will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
come to an inch.&rdquo; What if the eleventh hour
should strike after having been &ldquo;all the day
<i>idle</i>&rdquo;? A long lifetime of opportunities suffered
to pass unemployed and unimproved,
and absolutely <i>nothing</i> done for God! A
judgment-day come&mdash;our golden moments
squandered&mdash;our talents untraded on&mdash;our
work undone&mdash;met at the bar of Heaven with
the withering repulse, &ldquo;Inasmuch as ye did
it <i>not</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;The time we have lost,&rdquo; says
Richard Baxter, &ldquo;can not be recalled; should
we not then redeem and improve the little
that remains? If a traveler sleep or trifle
most of the day, he must travel so much the
faster in the evening, or fall short of his
journey&#8217;s end.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>COMMITTING OUR WAY TO GOD.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;But committed himself to Him that judgeth
righteously.&rdquo;&mdash;1 Peter, ii. 23.</p>

<p>With what perfect and entire confidingness
did Jesus commit Himself to his Heavenly
Father&#8217;s guidance! He loved to call Him,
&ldquo;My Father!&rdquo; There was music in that
name, which enabled Him to face the most
trying hour, and to drink the most bitter cup.
The scoffing taunt arose at the scene of crucifixion:
&ldquo;He trusted in God that He would
deliver Him, let Him deliver Him!&rdquo; It failed
to shake, for one moment, His unswerving
confidence, even when the sensible tokens of
the Divine presence were withdrawn; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
realized consciousness of God&#8217;s abiding love
sustained Him still: &ldquo;My God! my God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How many a perplexity should we save
ourselves by thus implicitly &ldquo;committing
ourselves,&rdquo; as He did, to God! In seasons of
darkness and trouble&mdash;when our way is shut
up with thorns, to lift the confiding eye of
faith to Him, and say, &ldquo;I am oppressed, undertake
for me!&rdquo; How blessed to feel that
He directs all that befalls us; that no contingencies
can frustrate His plans; that the
way he leads us is not only <i>a</i> &ldquo;right way,&rdquo;
but, with all its briers and thorns&mdash;<i>its</i> tears
and trials&mdash;it is <i>the</i> right way!</p>

<p>The result of such an habitual staying ourselves
on the Lord will be a deep, abiding
<i>peace</i>; any ripple will only be on the surface&mdash;no
more. It is the <i>bosom</i> of the ocean alone
which the storm ruffles; all beneath is a
serene, settled calm. So &ldquo;Thou wilt keep
him, oh God, in perfect peace, whose mind is
stayed on <i>Thee</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
want.&rdquo; I shall be content alike with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
He appoints or withholds. I <i>can not</i> wrong
that love with one shadow of suspicion! I
have His own plighted promise of unchanging
faithfulness, that &ldquo;all things work together for
good to them that love Him!&rdquo; Often there
are earthly sorrows hard to bear;&mdash;the unkind
accusation, when it was least merited or expected;
the estrangement of tried and trusted
friends, the failure of cherished hopes, favorite
schemes broken up, plans of usefulness demolished,
the gourd breeding its own worm
and withering. &ldquo;Commit thy cause and thy
way to God!&rdquo; We little know what tenderness
there is in the blast of the rough wind;
what &ldquo;needs be&rdquo; are folded under the wings
of the storm! &ldquo;All is well,&rdquo; because <i>all</i> is
from <i>Him</i>. &ldquo;Events are God&#8217;s,&rdquo; says Rutherford;
&ldquo;let Him sit at His own helm, that
moderateth all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christian! look back on your checkered
path. How wondrously has He threaded you
through the mazy way&mdash;disappointing your
fears, realizing your hopes! Are evils looming
through the mists of the future? Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
anticipate the trials of to-morrow, to aggravate
those of to-day. Leave the morrow with Him,
who has promised, by &ldquo;casting all your care
on Him, to care for you.&rdquo; No affliction will
be sent greater than you can bear. His voice
will be heard stealing from the bosom of the
threatening cloud, &ldquo;Be still, and know that I
am God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>My Father!</i>&rdquo; With such a word, you can
stretch out your neck for any yoke; as with
Israel of old, He will make those very waves
that may now be so threatening, a fenced wall
on every side! &ldquo;Rest in the Lord, and wait
patiently for Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;In <i>all</i> thy ways acknowledge
Him, and He shall direct thy
paths!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="arm">&ldquo;ARM YOURSELVES LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME MIND.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>LOVE OF UNITY.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;That they all may be one.&rdquo;&mdash;John, xvii. 21.</p>

<p>Surely there is nothing for which Christian
churches have such cause to hang their
harps on the willows, as the extent to which
the Shibboleth of party is heard in the camp
of the faithful&mdash;sectarianism rearing its &ldquo;untempered
walls&rdquo; within the Temple gates!</p>

<p>How different &ldquo;the mind of Jesus!&rdquo; Sent
&ldquo;to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,&rdquo; He
was never found disowning &ldquo;<i>other</i> sheep not
of that fold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Them also will I bring,&rdquo; was
an assertion continually illustrated by His
deeds. Take one example: The woman of
Samaria revealed what, alas! is too common
in the world&mdash;a total absence of all real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
religion, along with an ardent zeal for her
sect. She was living in open sin; yet she was
all alive to the nice distinction between a Jew
and a Samaritan&mdash;between Mount Gerizim
and Mount Zion: &ldquo;How is it that thou, being
a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman
of Samaria?&rdquo; Did Jesus sanction or reciprocate
her sectarianism?&mdash;did He leave her
bigotry unrebuked? Hear His reply&mdash;&ldquo;If
thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is
that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
wouldst have asked of <i>Him</i>, and <i>He</i> would
have given thee!&rdquo; <i>He</i> would have allowed
no such narrow-minded exclusiveness to have
interfered with the interchange of kindly civilities
with a stranger. Nay, He would have
given thee, better than all, the &ldquo;living water&rdquo;
which &ldquo;springeth up to everlasting life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How sad, that when the enemy is &ldquo;coming
in like a flood&rdquo;&mdash;the ranks of Popery and infidelity
linked in fatal and formidable confederacy&mdash;that
the soldiers of Christ are forced
to meet the assault with standards soiled and
mutilated by internal feuds! &ldquo;Uniformity&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
there <i>may</i> not be, but &ldquo;unity,&rdquo; in the true
sense of the word, there <i>ought</i> to be. We
may be clad in different livery, but let us
stand side by side, and rank by rank, fighting
the battles of our Lord. We may be different
branches of the seven golden candlesticks,
varying and diversified in outward form and
workmanship; but let us combine in &ldquo;showing
forth the praises of Him&rdquo; who recognizes, as
the one true &ldquo;churchmanship,&rdquo; fidelity in
shining for His glory &ldquo;as lights in the world.&rdquo;
How can we read the 13th chapter of 1st Corinthians,
and then think of our divisions?
&ldquo;How miserable,&rdquo; says Edward Bickersteth,
&ldquo;would an hospital be, if each patient were to
be so offended with his neighbor&#8217;s disease, as
to differ with him on account of it, instead of
trying to alleviate it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah! if we had more real communion with
our Saviour, should we not have more real
communion with one another? If Christians
would dip their arrows more in &ldquo;the balm of
Gilead,&rdquo; would there not be fewer wounds in
the body of Christ? &ldquo;How that word &lsquo;<i>toleration</i>&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
is used amongst us,&rdquo; said one who drank
deeper than most, of his Master&#8217;s spirit&mdash;&ldquo;how
we <i>tolerate</i> one another&mdash;Dissenters <i>tolerate</i>
Churchmen, and Churchmen <i>tolerate</i> Dissenters!
Oh! hateful word! <span class="smcap">Tolerate</span> one
for whom <i>Jesus</i> died! <i>Tolerate</i> one whom
He bears upon His heart! <i>Tolerate</i> a temple
of the living God! Oh! there ought to
be <i>that</i> in the word which should make us
feel <i>ashamed</i> before God!&rdquo;</p>

<h4>NOT OF THE WORLD.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;I am not of the world.&rdquo;&mdash;John, xvii. 14.</p>

<p>In one sense it was <i>not</i> so. Jesus did not
seek to maintain His holiness intact and unspotted
by avoiding contact with the world.
He mingled familiarly in its busy crowds.
He frowned on none of its innocent enjoyments;
He fostered, by His example, no love
of seclusion; He gave no warrant or encouragement
to mortified pride, or disappointed
hopes, to rush from its duties; yet, with all
this, what a halo of heavenliness encircled
His pathway through it! &ldquo;I am from above,&rdquo;
was breathed in His every look, and word,
and action, from the time when He lay in the
slumbers of guileless infancy in His Bethlehem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
cradle, until He said, &ldquo;I leave the world,
and go to my Father!&rdquo; He had moved uncontaminated
through its varied scenes, like
the sunbeam, which, whatever it touches, remains
as unsullied, as when it issues from
its great fountain.</p>

<p>But though Himself in His sinless nature
&ldquo;unconquerable&rdquo; by temptation&mdash;immutably
secure from the world&#8217;s malignant influences,
it is all worthy of note, as an example to us,
that He never unnecessarily braved these.
He knew the seducing spell that same world
would exercise on His people, of whom, with
touching sympathy, He says, &ldquo;<i>These</i> are in
the world!&rdquo; He knew the <i>many</i> who would
be involved and ensnared in its subtle worship,
who, &ldquo;minding earthly things, would
seek to slake their thirst at polluted streams!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! the great problem you have to
solve, Jesus has solved for you&mdash;to be &ldquo;<i>in</i> the
world, and yet not <i>of</i> it.&rdquo; To abandon it,
would be a dereliction of duty. It would be
servants deserting their work; soldiers flying
from the battle-field. <i>Live</i> in it, that while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
you live, the world, may feel the better
for you. <i>Die</i>, that <i>when</i> you die, the world,
the <i>Church</i>, may feel your loss, and cherish
your example! On its cares and duties,
its trusts and responsibilities, its employments
and enjoyments, inscribe the motto,
&ldquo;The world passeth away!&rdquo; Beware of
every thing in it that would tend to deaden
spirituality of heart; unfitting the mind for
serious thought, lowering the standard of
Christian duty, and inducing a perilous conformity
to its false manners, habits, tastes,
and principles. As the best antidote to the
love of the world, let the inner <i>vacuum</i> of
the heart be filled with the love of God.
Seek to feel the nobility of your regenerated
nature; that you have a nobler heritage to
care for than the transitory glories which encircle
&ldquo;an indivisible point, a fugitive atom.&rdquo;
How can I mix with the potsherds of the
earth? Once, &ldquo;I lay among the pots;&rdquo; now,
I am &ldquo;like a dove, whose wings are covered
with silver, and her feathers with yellow
gold!&rdquo; &ldquo;Stranger&mdash;pilgrim&mdash;sojourner&rdquo; &ldquo;my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<i>citizenship</i> is in heaven!&rdquo; Why covet tinsel
honors and glories? Why be solicitous about
the smiles of that which knew not (nay,
which frowned on) its Lord? &ldquo;Paul calls it,&rdquo;
says an old writer, &ldquo;<i>schema</i> (a mathematical
figure), which is a mere <i>notion</i>, and nothing in
substance.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Thomas Brooks.</i>)</p>

<p>Live above its corroding cares and anxieties;
remembering the description Jesus gives of
His own true people; &ldquo;They are not of the
world, even as I am not of the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="arm">&ldquo;ARM YOURSELVES LIKEWISE WITH THE SAME MIND.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>CALMNESS IN DEATH.</h4>

<p class="biblequote">&ldquo;Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit.&rdquo;&mdash;Luke,
xxiii. 46.</p>

<p>In the death of Jesus, there were elements
of fearfulness, which the believer can know
nothing of. It was with Him the execution of
a penal sentence. The sins of an elect world
were bearing him down! The very voice of
His God was giving the tremendous summons,
&ldquo;Awake, O sword, against my shepherd!&rdquo;
Yet His was a death of <i>peace</i>, nay, of <i>triumph</i>!
Ere He closed His eyes, light broke through
the curtains of thick darkness. In the calm
composure of filial confidence He breathed
away His soul&mdash;&ldquo;Father, into Thy hands I
commend My spirit!&rdquo; What was the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of such tranquillity? This is His own key to
it&mdash;&ldquo;I have glorified Thee on the earth; I have
finished the work which Thou gavest me to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reader! will it be so with <i>you</i> at a dying
hour? will <i>your</i> &ldquo;work&rdquo; be done? Have
you already fled to Jesus? Are you reposing
in Him as your only Saviour, and following
Him as your only pattern? Then&mdash;let death
overtake you when it may&mdash;you will have
nothing to do <i>but to die</i>! The grave will be
irradiated with His presence and smile. He
will be standing there as He did by His own
tomb of old, pointing to yours, tenanted with
angel forms, nay, Himself as the &ldquo;Precursor,&rdquo;
showing you &ldquo;<i>the path of life!</i>&rdquo; There can
be no true peace till the fear of death be conquered
by the sense of sin forgiven, through
&ldquo;the blood of the Cross.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not till then,&rdquo; as
one has it, &ldquo;will you be able to be a quiet
spectator of the open grave at the bottom of
the hill which you are soon to descend.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The sting of death is <i>sin</i>, but thanks be to
God who giveth us the victory through the
Lord Jesus Christ!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Seek now to live in the enjoyment of
greater filial nearness to your covenant God;
and thus, when the hour of departure <i>does</i>
come, you will be able, without irreverence,
to take the very words of your dying Lord,
and make them your own&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Father!</span> into
Thy hands I commend my spirit.&rdquo; <span class="smcap">Father!</span>
It is going <span class="smcap lowercase">HOME!</span> the heart of the child leaping
at the thought of the paternal roof, and
the paternal welcome! &ldquo;Son, thou art ever
with me, and all that I have is thine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is said of Archbishop Leighton, that he
&ldquo;was always happiest when, from the shaking
of the prison-doors, he was led to hope that
some of those brisk blasts would throw them
open, and give him the release he coveted.&rdquo;
Christian! can you dread <i>that</i> which your
Saviour has already vanquished? <i>Death!</i> It
is as the angel to Peter, breaking the dungeon-doors,
and leading to open day; it is going to
the world of your birthright, and leaving the
one of your exile; &ldquo;it is the soldier at night-fall,
lying down in his tent in peace, waiting
the morning to receive his laurels.&rdquo; Oh! to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
be ever living in a state of holy preparation!
the mental eye gazing on the vista-view of an
opening Heaven! feeling that <i>every moment</i> is
bringing us nearer and nearer that happy
<i>Home</i>! soon to be within reach of the
Heavenly threshold, in sight of the Throne!
soon to be bending in adoring rapture with
the Church triumphant&mdash;bathing in floods of
infinite glory&mdash;&ldquo;LIKE HIM,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;seeing <span class="smcap">Him</span>
<i>as He is</i>,&rdquo; and that <i>for Ever and Ever</i>!</p>

<p class="arm">&ldquo;AND EVERY MAN THAT HATH THIS HOPE IN HIM PURIFIETH
HIMSELF, EVEN AS HE IS PURE!&rdquo;</p>

including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
